            "content": "The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, which does business as BNY Mellon, is an American worldwide banking and financial services holding company headquartered in New York City. It was formed on July 1, 2007, as a result of the merger of The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation. The merger made the company one of the world's largest custodian banks and asset servicing companies.[7][8][9] Through its Bank of New York predecessor, it is one of the three oldest banking corporations in the United States, and among the oldest banks in the world, having been established in June 1784 by a group that included American Founding Fathers Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton.[10] Mellon had been founded in 1869.   The first bank in the U.S. was the Bank of North America in Philadelphia, which was chartered by the Continental Congress in 1781; Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were among its founding shareholders.[10] In February 1784, The Massachusetts Bank in Boston was chartered.[10] The shipping industry in New York City chafed under the lack of a bank, and investors envied the 14% dividends that Bank of North America paid, and months of local discussion culminated in a June 1784 meeting at a coffee house on St. George's Square which led to the formation of the Bank of New York company; it operated without a charter for seven years. The initial plan was to capitalize the company with $750,000, a third in cash and the rest in mortgages, but after this was disputed the first offering was to capitalize it with $500,000 in gold or silver. When the bank opened on June 9, 1784, the full $500,000 had not been raised; 723 shares had been sold, held by 192 people. Aaron Burr had three of them, and Hamilton had one and a half shares. The first president was Alexander McDougall and the Cashier was William Seton.[11][12] [13] [14] Its first offices were in the old Walton Mansion in New York City.[11][7][12] In 1787 it moved to a site on Hanover Square that the New York Cotton Exchange later moved into.[11] The bank provided the United States government its first loan in 1789. The loan was orchestrated by Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, and it paid the salaries of United States Congress members and President George Washington.[15] The Bank of New York was the first company to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange when it first opened in 1792.[16] In 1796 the bank moved to a location at the corner of Wall Street and Williams Street.[11] The bank had a monopoly on banking services in the city until the Bank of the Manhattan Company was founded by Aaron Burr in 1799; the Bank of New York and Hamilton vigorously opposed its founding.[11] During the 1800s, the bank was known for its conservative lending practices that allowed it to weather financial crises. It was involved in the funding of the Morris and Erie canals, and steamboat companies.[17][18] The bank helped finance both the War of 1812 and the Union Army during the American Civil War.[19][20] Following the Civil War, the bank loaned money to many major infrastructure projects, including utilities, railroads, and the New York City Subway.[17] Through the early 1900s, the Bank of New York continued to expand and prosper.[18][20] In July 1922, the bank merged with the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company.[21] The bank continued to profit and pay dividends throughout the Great Depression, and its total deposits increased during the decade.[18][20] In 1948, the Bank again merged, this time with the Fifth Avenue Bank, which was followed by a merger in 1966 with the Empire Trust Company.[17][20] The bank's holding company was created in 1969.[17] In 1988, the Bank of New York merged with Irving Bank Corporation after a year-long hostile take over bid by Bank of New York.[22] Irving had been headquartered at 1 Wall Street and after the merger, this became the headquarters of the Bank of New York.[23] From 1993 to 1998, the bank made 33 acquisitions, including acquiring JP Morgan\u2019s Global Custody Business in 1995.[20] Ivy Asset Management was acquired in 2000, and the bank acquired Pershing LLC, the United States' second-largest trade clearinghouse, in 2003.[20][24] In 2005 the bank settled a US federal investigation that began in 1996 concerning money laundering related to post-Soviet privatization in Russia. The illegal operation involved two Russian emigres, one of whom was a Vice President of the bank, moving over US$7 billion via hundreds of wires.[25][26] In 2006, the Bank of New York traded its retail banking and regional middle-market businesses for J.P. Morgan Chase's corporate trust assets. The deal signaled the bank's exit from retail banking.[27] Mellon Financial was founded as T. Mellon & Sons' Bank in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1869 by retired judge Thomas Mellon and his sons Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon.[28] The bank invested in and helped found numerous industrial firms in the late 1800s and early 1900s including Alcoa, Westinghouse, Gulf Oil, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel.[29][30] Both Gulf Oil and Alcoa are, according to the financial media, considered to be T. Mellon & Sons' most successful financial investments.[29][30] In 1902, T. Mellon & Sons' name was changed to the Mellon National Bank.[29] The firm merged with the Union Trust Company, a business founded by Andrew Mellon, in 1946. The newly formed organization resulting from the merger was named the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, and was Pittsburgh's first US$1\u00a0billion bank.[31] The bank formed the first dedicated family office in the United States in 1971.[32] A reorganization in 1972 led to the bank's name changing to Mellon Bank, N.A. and the formation of a holding company, Mellon National Corporation.[28][29] Mellon Bank acquired multiple banks and financial institutions in Pennsylvania during the 1980s and 1990s.[33] In 1992, Mellon acquired 54 branch offices of Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, the first savings bank in the United States, founded in 1819.[34] In 1993, Mellon acquired The Boston Company from American Express and AFCO Credit Corporation from The Continental Corporation. The following year, Mellon merged with the Dreyfus Corporation, bringing its mutual funds under its umbrella.[29] In 1999, Mellon Bank Corporation became Mellon Financial Corporation. Two years later, it exited the retail banking business by selling its assets and retail bank branches to Citizens Financial Group.[29] On December 4, 2006, the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation announced they would merge.[35] The merger created the world's largest securities servicing company and one of the largest asset management firms by combining Mellon\u2019s wealth-management business and the Bank of New York\u2019s asset-servicing and short-term-lending specialties.[7][35] The companies anticipated saving about $700 million in costs and cutting around 3,900 jobs, mostly by attrition.[7] The deal was valued at $16.5 billion and under its terms, the Bank of New York's shareholders received 0.9434 shares in the new company for each share of the Bank of New York that they owned, while Mellon Financial shareholders received 1 share in the new company for each Mellon share they owned.[19] The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial entered into mutual stock option agreements for 19.9 percent of the issuer's outstanding common stock.[35] The merger was finalized on July 1, 2007.[9] The company's principal office of business at the One Wall Street office previously held by the Bank of New York.[8] The full name of the company became The Bank of New York Mellon Corp., with the BNY Mellon brand name being used for most lines of business.[8][9] In October 2008, the U.S. Treasury named BNY Mellon the master custodian of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout fund during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2010. BNY Mellon won the assignment, which included handling accounting and record-keeping for the program, through a bidding process.[36] In November 2008, the company announced that it would lay-off 1,800 employees, or 4 percent of its global workforce, due to the financial crisis.[37] According to the results of a February 2009 stress test conducted by federal regulators, BNY Mellon was one of only three banks that could withstand a worsening economic situation.[38] The company received $3 billion from TARP, which it paid back in full in June 2009, along with US$136 million to buy back warrants from the Treasury in August 2009.[39][40] In August 2009, BNY Mellon purchased Insight Investment, a management business for external funds, from Lloyds Banking Group.[41] The company acquired PNC Financial Services' Global Investment Servicing Inc. in July 2010 and Talon Asset Management's wealth management business in 2011.[42][43] In September 2009, BNY Mellon settled a lawsuit that had been filed against the Bank of New York by the Russian government in May 2007 for money laundering; the original suit claimed $22.5 billion in damages and was settled for $14 million.[44][45] In October, 2011, the Justice Department and New York's attorney general filed civil lawsuits against the Bank of New York, alleging foreign currency fraud. The suits hold that the bank deceived pension-fund clients by manipulating the prices assigned to them for foreign currency transactions. Allegedly, the bank selected the day's lowest rates for currency sales and highest rates for purchases, appropriating the difference as corporate profit. The scheme is said to have generated $2 billion for the bank, at the expense of millions of Americans' retirement funds, and to have transpired over more than a decade. Purportedly, the bank would offer secret pricing deals to clients who raised concerns, in order to avoid discovery. Bank of New York has defended itself vigorously, maintaining the fraud accusations are \"flat out wrong\" and warning that as the bank employs 8,700 employees in New York, any damage to the bank would have negative repercussions for the state of New York.[46][47] By 2013, the company's capital had steadily risen from the financial crisis. In the results of the Federal Reserve's Dodd-Frank stress test in 2013, the bank was least affected by hypothetical extreme economic scenarios among banks tested.[48] It was also a top performer on the same test in 2014.[49] BNY Mellon began a marketing campaign in 2013 to increase awareness of the company that included a new slogan and logo.[50][51] In 2013, the bank started building a new IT system called NEXEN.[52][53] NEXEN uses open source technology and includes components such as an API store, data analytics, and a cloud computing environment.[54][55] In May 2014, BNY Mellon sold its 1 Wall Street headquarters[56] and in 2015 moved into leased space at Brookfield Place.[57] In June 2014, the company combined its global markets, global collateral services and prime services to create the new Markets Group,[58] also known as BNY Markets Mellon.[59] The company expanded its Hong Kong office in October 2014 as part of the company's plans to grow its wealth management business.[60] Between 2014 and 2016, BNY Mellon opened innovation centers focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects, first in Silicon Valley,[61][62][63] In March 2015, the company admitted to facts concerning the misrepresentation of foreign exchange pricing and execution. BNY Mellon's alleged misconduct in this area includes representing pricing as best rates to its clients, when in fact they were providing clients with bad prices while retaining larger margins. In addition to letting go key executives, the company agreed to pay a total of US$714 million to settle related lawsuits.[64] In September 2017, BNY Mellon announced that it agreed to sell CenterSquare Investment Management to its management team and the private equity firm Lovell Minnick Partners. The transaction is subject to standard regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed by the end of 2017.[65] Asset & Liability[66] Asset/Liability Ratio[66] Net Income[66] BNY Mellon operates in 35 countries in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia-Pacific.[67][68] The company employed 52,000 people as of December 2016[6]. As of October 2015[update], the group's American and global headquarters are located at 225 Liberty Street, as the former 1 Wall Street building was sold in 2014.[57] The group's EMEA headquarters are located in London and its Asia-Pacific headquarters are located in Hong Kong.[69][70] The Bank's primary functions are managing and servicing the investments of institutions and high-net-worth individuals.[16] BNY Mellon's two primary businesses are Investment Services and Investment Management,[71] which offer services for each stage of investment, from creation through to trading, holding, management, distribution and restructuring.[72][73] BNY Mellon's clients include 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies.[74] The company also serves 77 percent of the top 100 endowments, 87 percent of the top 1,000 pension and employee benefit funds, 51 percent of the top 200 life and health insurance companies and 50 percent of the top 50 universities.[75] BNY Mellon's Investment Services business represents approximately 72 percent of the company's revenue[76] and it has $31.1 trillion under its custody or administration as of September 2016.[77] The financial services offered by the business include asset servicing, alternative investment services, broker-dealer services, corporate trust services and treasury services.[68][71] Other offerings include global collateral services, foreign exchange, securities lending, middle and back office outsourcing, and depository receipts.[68][71] BNY Mellon's subsidiary Pershing LLC handles securities services, including execution, settlement, and clearing. It also provides back office support to financial advisors.[78][79] In 2014, the company formed a new Markets Group, which offers collateral management, securities finance, foreign exchange and capital markets.[58] The group is now known as BNY Mellon Markets.[59] BNY Mellon's Investment Management business generates 28 percent of the company's revenue[76] and had US$1.7 trillion (Q4 2016) in assets under management.[80][81][3] The Investment Management business operates several asset management boutiques and as of 2014 was the largest multi-boutique investment manager in the world.[73][82] BNY Mellon's Wealth Management unit handles the private banking, estate planning, family office services, and investment servicing and management of high-net-worth individuals and families.[68][83] As of 2014, it ranks 7th among wealth management businesses in the United States. Starting in 2013, the unit began expansion efforts, including opening eight new banking offices, increasing salespeople, bankers, and portfolio managers on staff, and launching an awareness campaign for wealth management services through television ads.[83] In July 2017 the company announced that CEO and Chairman Gerald Hassell would retire at the end of 2017; Charles W. Scharf was appointed as CEO in July and was set to become Chairman after Hassell retired.[84][85] Hassell had been Chairman and CEO since 2011, after serving as BNY Mellon's president from 2007 to 2012[85] and as the president of the Bank of New York Mellon from 1998 until its merger.[86] Karen Peetz served as president (the bank's first female president) from 2013 to 2016, when she retired; the company did not appoint a new president when she retired.[87][88] Thomas Gibbons has been CFO since 2008 and also serves as vice chairman.[89] BNY Mellon's Investment Management business is run by CEO Mitchell Harris,[90] and the company's Investment Services business is led by CEO Brian Shea.[91] As of July 2017, the company's board members were Linda Z. Cook, Nicholas M. Donofrio, Joseph J. Echevarria, Edward P. Garden, Jeffrey A. Goldstein, Gerald L. Hassell, John M. Hinshaw, Edmund F. (Ted) Kelly, John A. Luke Jr., Jennifer B. Morgan, Mark A. Nordenberg, Elizabeth E. Robinson, Charles W. Scharf and Samuel C. Scott III.[92] In 2008, BNY Mellon formed a Board of Directors corporate social responsibility committee to set sustainability goals for the company.[93][94] The company's corporate social responsibility activities include philanthropy, social finance in the communities the bank is located in, and protecting financial markets globally.[95] BNY Mellon's philanthropic activities include financial donations and volunteerism.[96] The company matches employee volunteer hours and donations with financial contributions through its Community Partnership program.[97] Between 2010 and 2012, the company and its employees donated approximately $100 million to charity.[96] In 2014, the company worked with the Forbes Fund to create a platform that connects nonprofit organizations with private businesses to solve social challenges.[98] The company received a 100 A rating in 2013, 2014 and 2015 by the CDP, which measures corporate greenhouse gas emissions and disclosures.[94][99][100] BNY Mellon was named on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in 2013,[101] 2014 and 2015, and the World Index in 2014,[102] 2015[103] and 2016.[104] Another one of the company's focuses has been building efficiency. As of 2014, the company has saved $48 million due to building efficiency. Five of its buildings have achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED-EB) certification and 23 have interiors that are LEED certified.[94] BNY Mellon also has business resource groups for employees that are focused on diversity and inclusion.[95][105] In 2009, Karen Peetz co-founded the BNY Mellon Women\u2019s Initiative Network (WIN), a resource group for female employees' professional development.[106] As of 2013, WIN had 50 chapters.[107] Other groups include PRISM for LGBT employees, IMPACT, which serves multicultural employees and HEART for employees with disabilities.[105] BNY Mellon also has services for returning military, including a tool to help veterans align military skills and training with jobs at the company.[108] In 2014, BNY Mellon was recognized for its diversity practices by the National Business Inclusion Consortium, which named it Financial Services Diversity Corporation of the Year.[109] In 2009, the company began an innovation program for employees to suggest ideas for large-scale projects and company improvement. Ideas from the initial pilot program generated approximately $165 million in pretax profit. The program results in an annual contest called \"ACE\" in which teams pitch their ideas.[110] As of 2015 BNY Mellon was the world's largest custody bank,[76][111] the sixth largest investment management firm in the world[112] and the seventh largest wealth management firm in the United States.[60] In 2017, BNY Mellon ranked 177 on the Fortune 500[113] and 250 on the Financial Times Global 500.[114] It was named one of world's 50 Safest Banks by Global Finance in 2013 and 2014,[115][116] and one of the 20 Most Valuable Banking Brands in 2014 by The Banker.[117] The bank says it is the oldest bank in the United States, and whether it deserves this recognition is sometimes disputed by its rivals and also by some historians.[10] The Bank of North America was chartered in 1781, and was absorbed by a series of other entities until it was acquired by Wells Fargo. Similarly, The Massachusetts Bank went through a series of acquisitions and ended up as part of Bank of America. The Bank of New York remained independent, absorbing other companies, until its merger with Mellon. There is no doubt that the BNY Mellon is at least the third oldest bank in the US.[10] Since 2012, BNY Mellon has expanded its number of sponsorships.[118]It is the title sponsor of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race in London, which had been called the BNY Mellon Boat race from 2012 to 2015.[118][119][120]The company also sponsors the Head of the Charles Regatta in Boston.[118] In 2013, the company became a 10-year sponsor of the San Francisco 49ers and a founding partner of Levi's Stadium.[121] The company is a regular sponsor of the Royal Academy of Arts in London.[122]",

While the bank expanded here and there over the course of the next 14 decades, its greatest growth occurred in just the last 15 years. In anticipation of expanding its franchise through the first of several mergers, the Bank changed its name to New York Community Bank on November 21, 2000. By the end of that year, NYCB had grown from 14 to 86 branches; today, it has more than 220 branches in five states. In deference to its heritage as a Queens-based institution, the Community Bank operates each of its 38 branches in the county under its original name, Queens County Savings Bank. Roslyn Savings Bank Established in 1875, The Roslyn Savings Bank was the first financial institution headquartered in Nassau County, one of two counties--with Suffolk--that constitute Long Island, New York.\u00a0Its founders wanted to build a bank that would provide the Island\u2019s residents with a safe place for their savings, as well as the financial assistance they\u2019d need to build or purchase homes. A member of the NYCB Family of Bank since October 31, 2003, Roslyn Savings Bank today serves the Island\u2019s businesses and consumers through 42 conveniently placed branch offices.  Richmond County Savings Bank A member of the NYCB Family of Banks since July 31, 2001, Richmond County Savings Bank is the third oldest of our divisions, with roots that go back to October 30, 1886.\u00a0It was then that the bank was established to serve those who lived and worked on Staten Island, and it was less than one year later that it made its first mortgage loan. Today, nearly every street on the Island has at least one home that was financed by Richmond County Savings Bank. Originally located in the Odd Fellows Building at the corner of Richmond Terrace and Broadway, the Bank today has 20 convenient banking locations in all. Roosevelt Savings Bank Roosevelt Savings Bank was established in 1895 on the corner of Gates Avenue and Broadway in Brooklyn under the name \u201cEastern District Savings Bank.\u201d In 1920, the bank changed its name to honor the memory of the nation\u2019s 26th president, Theodore Roosevelt. In February 1999, Roosevelt Savings Bank merged with and into Roslyn Bancorp, which merged with and into New York Community Bancorp, Inc. in October 2003.\u00a0 Today, Roosevelt Savings Bank serves its customers through\u00a0seven branches in Brooklyn as a member of the NYCB Family of Banks. Garden State Community Bank Garden State Community Bank has been a member of the NYCB Family of Banks since March 2008, when we combined all the branches of four smaller New Jersey-based divisions--First Savings Bank of New Jersey, Ironbound Bank, Penn Federal Savings Bank, and Synergy Bank\u2014into a single division with a highly relatable name. While Penn Federal Savings Bank and Synergy Bank were directly acquired in 2007, First Savings Bank of New Jersey and Ironbound Bank were acquired in 1999 by Richmond County Financial Corp., which subsequently merged with NYCB. By combining the strengths of these four local banks with the strengths of our institution, we established a Garden State community bank that offers more products and services, and more convenient locations, than any one of these banks provided on its own. Today, we serve our customers through 45 branches in Essex, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, and Union Counties, most of which first opened their doors nearly 14 decades ago.  AmTrust Bank AmTrust Bank is one of the more recent additions to a respected banking family that has been serving customers and communities for more than 156 years. The first branch of AmTrust Bank opened its doors in the late 1980s, when Ohio Savings Bank opened the first of its branches in south coastal Florida under the \u201cAmTrust Bank\u201d name.\u00a0Eleven years later, it expanded again--this time to Arizona--and on December 4, 2009, it joined the NYCB Family of Banks.\u00a0With our acquisition of Desert Hills Bank less than four months later, we further expanded our franchise in the Grand Canyon State. Currently in its seventh year as an NYCB division, AmTrust Bank serves its customers through 41 convenient branches:\u00a014 in central Arizona and 27 in Florida. Ohio Savings Bank Ohio Savings Bank is one of the more recent additions to a respected banking family that has been serving customers and communities for more than 156 years. Established in 1889 as the Ohio Savings Home Loan and Building Co., the bank\u2019s initial expansion was limited to Ohio until it opened its first Florida branch in 1989.\u00a0Eleven years later, it expanded again, this time to Arizona.\u00a0And seven years later, it changed its name to AmTrust Bank. On December 4, 2009, AmTrust Bank became the newest member of our banking family, the first of our divisions to serve customers in non-contiguous states. Four months later, we elected to pay tribute to its forebear, by operating our 28 branches in Ohio under a more suitable name:\u00a0Ohio Savings Bank. ",

            "content": "William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, author, philanthropist, and co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation along with Paul Allen.[2][3] In 1975, Gates and Allen launched Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[4][a] Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself.[7] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[8] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[9] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[10] Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[11] Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000. Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[12] As of September 2017[update], he is the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$84.8\u00a0billion.[1] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13] The foundation works to save lives and improve global health, and is working with Rotary International to eliminate polio.[14]   Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (b. 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929\u20131994). His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish.[15][16] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates' maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" because his father had the \"II\" suffix.[17] Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him.[18] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[19][20][21] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that \"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing\".[22] At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school.[23] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.[24] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, \"There was just something neat about the machine.\"[25] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students\u00a0\u2013  Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans\u00a0\u2013  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[26][27] At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype. Subsequently, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with \"a disproportionate number of interesting girls.\"[28] He later stated that \"it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.\"[25] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[29] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.[30] Gates was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.[31] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[32][33] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[34] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO. He maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation from the company in 2014.[35] In his second year, Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[36] presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years;[36][37] its successor is faster by only one percent.[36] His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[38] While Gates was a student at Harvard,[39] he did not have a definite study plan, and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[40] The MITS Altair 8800 was released the following year. The new computer was based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[41] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much their son wanted to start his own company.[39] Gates explained his decision to leave Harvard, saying \"...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] leave [of absence].\"[42] After Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which demonstrated the Altair 8800, he contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[43] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,[44] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership \"Micro-Soft\" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.[44] Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name \"Microsoft\" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.[44] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies. Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 percent of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair \"hobby market\" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[45] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[44] The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979.[43] During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.[46][unreliable source?] IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating system for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[47] Big Blue first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[48] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.[49] Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.[49] They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[50] Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. PC Magazine asked if Gates were \"the man behind the machine?\",[47] and InfoWorld quoted an expert as stating \"it's Gates' computer\".[51] Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.[43] Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.[52] From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that \"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\"[53] Another executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor.\"[54] Gates was an executive who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[55][56] He interrupted presentations with such comments as \"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\"[57] and \"Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?\"[58] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.[57] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, \"I'll do it over the weekend.\"[59][60][61] During Microsoft's early history, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[62] but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products.[60] He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, \"Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.\"[63] On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that over the next two years he would transition out of his day-to-day role to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[64] Many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as, \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[65] BusinessWeek reported: Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[66] Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, \"Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree.\"[67] Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[67] In 2008, Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation.[68] As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a \"Yes\", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a \"Yes\". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about \"nothing\" (Seinfeld).[69] In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.[70] Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8\u00a0billion to US$78.5\u00a0billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[71] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside new CEO Satya Nadella.[10][72] Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: \"... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism.\" Gates also identified innovation as the \"real driver of progress\" and pronounced that \"America's way better today than it's ever been.\"[73] Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of superintelligence; in a Reddit \"ask me anything\", he stated that First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[74][75][76][77] In a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would \"highly recommend\" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[78] Gates' days are planned for him, similar to the US President's schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.[79] Gates married Melinda French on a golf course on the Hawaiian island of Lanai on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002). The family resides in a modern design mansion, which is an earth-sheltered house in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina near Seattle in Washington State, United States. According to 2007 King County public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125\u00a0million, and the annual property taxes are $991,000. The 66,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (6,100\u00a0m2) estate has a 60-foot (18\u00a0m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (230\u00a0m2) gym and a 1,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (93\u00a0m2) dining room.[80] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith: The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.[81] In the same interview, Gates said: \"I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm\u00a0\u2013 not all\u00a0\u2013 that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\"[81] The Codex Leicester is one of Gates' private acquisitions. He purchased the collection of famous scientific writings by Leonardo da Vinci for $30.8\u00a0million at an auction in 1994.[82] Gates is also known for being an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[83] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[84][85] In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101\u00a0billion.[86] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet.[87] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[88] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[89][90] Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014[91][92] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40\u00a0billion to more than US$82\u00a0billion.[93] Bill Gates has held the top spot on the list of The World's Billionaires for 18 out of the past 23 years.[94] Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.[95] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[96] In 2016, he was discussing his gaming habits when he revealed that he was color-blind.[97] In a BBC interview, Gates claimed \"I've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so... I've paid over $6 billion in taxes.\"[98] He is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich.[99] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13] Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the \"William H. Gates Foundation.\" In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6\u00a0billion.[100][101] The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[102][103] Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[104] As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28\u00a0billion to charity;[105] the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.[106] The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[107] The foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat Vitamin A deficiency.[108] Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in The Power of Half.[109] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a commitment they called the \"Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge.\" The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.[110][111][112] Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20\u00a0million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[113] The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[114] Gates also donated $6\u00a0million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[115] On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).[116] Since about 2005, Bill Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the \"Reinvent the Toilet Challenge\", which has received considerable media interest.[117] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was \"produced from human feces\" in 2014\u00a0\u2013 in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni-processor.[118][119] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[120] Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10\u00a0million each as their inheritance. With only $30\u00a0million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.[121] In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell to the developing world.[122] In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[123] It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[124] The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students.[125] The scholarship program is administered by the United Negro College Fund.[126] In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when he decided to donate $50 million to UNAIDS through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[127][128] On April 29, 2017, Bill Gates partnered with Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer in playing a noncompetitive tennis match to a packed house at Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[129] Federer and Gates played against John Isner and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McReady. Gates and Federer won the game 6\u20134. In 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's 400 Richest People in America issue. He was worth $1.25\u00a0billion and was the world's youngest self-made billionaire.[12] Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes The World's Billionaires list and was the wealthiest from 1995 to 1996,[130] 1998 to 2007, 2009, and has been since 2014.[1] Gates was number one on Forbes' 400 Richest Americans list from 1993 through to 2007.[131][needs update] Time magazine named Gates one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th century, as well as one of the 100 most influential people of 2004, 2005, and 2006. Time also collectively named Gates, his wife Melinda and U2's lead singer Bono as the 2005 Persons of the Year for their humanitarian efforts.[132] In 2006, he was voted eighth in the list of \"Heroes of our time\".[133] Gates was listed in the Sunday Times power list in 1999, named CEO of the year by Chief Executive Officers magazine in 1994, ranked number one in the \"Top 50 Cyber Elite\" by Time in 1998, ranked number two in the Upside Elite 100 in 1999, and was included in The Guardian as one of the \"Top 100 influential people in media\" in 2001.[134] According to Forbes, Gates was ranked as the fourth most powerful person in the world in 2012,[135] up from fifth in 2011.[136] In 1994, he was honored as the twentieth Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society. In 1999, Gates received New York Institute of Technology's President's Medal.[137] Gates has received honorary doctorates from Nyenrode Business Universiteit, Breukelen, The Netherlands, in 2000;[138] the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2002;[139] Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2005; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in April 2007;[140] Harvard University in June 2007;[141] the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, in 2007,[142] and Cambridge University in June 2009.[143] He was also made an honorary trustee of Peking University in 2007.[144] Gates was made an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.[145] In November 2006, he was awarded the Placard of the Order of the Aztec Eagle, together with his wife Melinda who was awarded the Insignia of the same order, both for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in Mexico, and specifically in the program \"Un pa\u00eds de lectores\".[146] Gates received the 2010 Bower Award for Business Leadership from The Franklin Institute for his achievements at Microsoft and his philanthropic work.[147] Also in 2010, he was honored with the Silver Buffalo Award by the Boy Scouts of America, its highest award for adults, for his service to youth.[148] Entomologists named Bill Gates' flower fly, Eristalis gatesi, in his honor in 1997.[149] In 2002, Bill and Melinda Gates received the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged.[150] In 2006, Gates received the James C. Morgan Global Humanitarian Award from The Tech Awards.[151] In 2015, Gates, along with his wife Melinda, received the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian award for their social work in the country.[152][153] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Gates and his wife Melinda with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their philanthropic efforts.[154] In 2017, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande awarded Bill and Melinda with the France's highest national award \u2013 Legion of Honour in Paris for their charity efforts.[155] To date, Bill Gates has written two books: In 2013, Gates became a LinkedIn Influencer.[161] Gates was the guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on January 31, 2016, in which he talks about his relationships with his father and Steve Jobs, meeting his then future wife Melinda Ann French, the start of Microsoft and some of his habits (for example reading The Economist \"from cover to cover every week\"). His choice of things to take on a desert island were, for music: \"Blue Skies\" by Willie Nelson; book: The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker; and luxury item: a DVD Collection of Lectures from The Teaching Company.[162]",

            "content": "Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates (born October 28, 1955) and his partner Paul Allen founded and built the world's largest software business, Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Gates announced that he was stepping down as Microsoft's chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In March 1986, Bill Gates took Microsoft public with an initial public offering (IPO) of $21 per share, making him an instant millionaire at age 31. Gates held 45 percent of the company's 24.7 million shares, making his stake at that time $234 million of Microsoft's $520 million.\u00a0 Over time, the company's stock increased in value and split numerous times. In 1987, Bill Gates became a billionaire when the stock hit $90.75 a share. Since then, Gates has been at the top, or at least near the top, of Forbes' annual list of the top 400 wealthiest people in America. In 1999, with stock prices at an all-time high and the stock splitting eight-fold since its IPO, Gates' wealth briefly topped $101 billion. In 1997, Gates and his family moved into a 55,000-square-foot, $54-million house on the shore of Lake Washington. Though the house serves as a business center, it is said to be very cozy for the couple and their three children.\u00a0 In 1987, a 23-year-old Microsoft product manager named Melinda French caught the eye of Bill Gates, then 32. The very bright and organized Melinda was a perfect match for Gates. In time, their relationship grew as they discovered an intimate and intellectual connection. On January 1, 1994, Melinda and Bill were married in Hawaii.\u00a0 Following the devastating death of his mother to breast cancer just a few months after their wedding, Bill and Melinda took some time off in 1995 to travel and get a new perspective on life and the world. In 1996, their first daughter, Jennifer, was born. Their son, Rory, was born in 1999, and a second daughter, Phoebe, arrived in 2002. READ ARTICLE: 7 Fun Facts About Bill Gates. In 1994, Bill and Melinda Gates established the William H. Gates Foundation, which was dedicated to supporting education, world health and investment in low-income communities. With Melinda's influence, Bill had taken an interest in becoming a civic leader in the footsteps of his mother, studying the philanthropic work of American industrial titans Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. He realized that he had an obligation to give more of his wealth to charity. In 2000, the couple combined several family foundations and made a $28 billion contribution to form the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2000, Bill Gates stepped down from the day-to-day operations of Microsoft, turning over the job of CEO to college friend Steve Ballmer, who had been with Microsoft since 1980. He positioned himself as chief software architect so he could concentrate on what was for him the more passionate side of the business, though he remained chairman of the board.\u00a0 Over the next few years, Bill\u2019s involvement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation occupied much of his time and even more of his interest. In 2006, Gates announced he was transitioning himself from full-time work at Microsoft to devote more quality time to the foundation. His last full day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. In February 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in order to move into a new position as technology adviser; longtime Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was replaced by 46-year-old Satya Nadella. Gates continues to devote much of his time and energy to the work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The organization tackles international and domestic issues, such as health and education and helping students in the United States become college-ready. In 2015, Gates spoke out in favor of national Common Core standards in grades K through 12 and charter schools. Gates also proved to be a groundbreaking employer when, around this time, the foundation announced that it would give its employees a year's paid leave after the birth or the adoption of a child.\u00a0 Bill Gates was born William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington.\u00a0 Bill Gates grew up in an upper middle-class family with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their father, William H. Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law student when he met his future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an athletic, outgoing student at the University of Washington, actively involved in student affairs and leadership. The Gates family atmosphere was warm and close, and all three children were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence. Bill showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family athletic games at their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished in playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled at Monopoly.\u00a0 Bill had a very close relationship with his mother, Mary, who after a brief career as a teacher devoted her time to helping raise the children and working on civic affairs and with charities. She also served on several corporate boards, including those of the First Interstate Bank in Seattle (founded by her grandfather), the United Way and International Business Machines (IBM). She would often take Bill along when she volunteered in schools and at community organizations. Bill was a voracious reader as a child, spending many hours poring over reference books such as the encyclopedia. Around the age of 11 or 12, Bill's parents began to have concerns about his behavior. He was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times, and his parents worried he might become a loner. Though they were strong believers in public education, when Bill turned 13, they enrolled him at Seattle's exclusive preparatory Lakeside School. He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, excelling in math and science, but also doing very well in drama and English. While at Lakeside School, a Seattle computer company offered to provide computer time for the students. The Mother's Club used proceeds from the school's rummage sale to purchase a teletype terminal for students to use. Bill Gates became entranced with what a computer could do and spent much of his free time working on the terminal. He wrote a tic-tac-toe program in BASIC computer language that allowed users to play against the computer. Gates graduated from Lakeside in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the college SAT test, a feat of intellectual achievement that for several years he boasted about when introducing himself to new people. Gates enrolled at Harvard University in the fall of 1973, originally thinking of a career in law. But his freshman year saw him spend more of his time in the computer lab than in class. Gates did not really have a study regimen. Instead, he could get by on a few hours of sleep, cram for a test, and pass with a reasonable grade. Much to his parents' dismay, within two years Gates dropped out of college in 1975 to pursue his business, Microsoft, with partner Paul Allen. At Lakeside School Gates met Paul Allen, who was two years his senior. The pair became fast friends, bonding over their common enthusiasm for computers, even though they were very different people. Allen was more reserved and shy. Bill was feisty and at times combative. Regardless of their differences, they both spent much of their free time together working on programs. Occasionally, the two disagreed and would clash over who was right or who should run the computer lab. On one occasion, their argument escalated to the point where Allen banned Gates from the computer lab.\u00a0 At one point, Gates and Allen had their school computer privileges revoked for taking advantage of software glitches to obtain free computer time from the company that provided the computers. After their probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to debug the program. During this time, Gates developed a payroll program for the computer company the boys hacked into and a scheduling program for the school. In 1970, at the age of 15, Bill Gates and Paul Allen went into business together, developing \"Traf-o-Data,\" a computer program that monitored traffic patterns in Seattle. They netted $20,000 for their efforts. Gates and Allen wanted to start their own company, but Gates' parents wanted him to finish school and go on to college, where they hoped he would work to become a lawyer. Allen went to Washington State University, while Gates went to Harvard, though the pair stayed in touch. After attending college for two years, Allen dropped out and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to work for Honeywell. Around this time, he showed Gates an edition of Popular Electronics magazine featuring an article on the Altair 8800 mini-computer kit. Both boys were fascinated with the possibilities of what this computer could create in the world of personal computing.\u00a0 The Altair was made by a small company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). Gates and Allen contacted the company, proclaiming that they were working on a BASIC software program that would run the Altair computer. In reality, they didn't have an Altair to work with or the code to run it, but they wanted to know if MITS was interested in someone developing such software.\u00a0 MITS was, and its president, Ed Roberts, asked the boys for a demonstration. Gates and Allen scrambled, spending the next two months writing the software at Harvard's computer lab. Allen traveled to Albuquerque for a test run at MITS, never having tried it out on an Altair computer. It worked perfectly. Allen was hired at MITS, and Gates soon left Harvard to work with him. Together they founded Microsoft.\u00a0 Paul Allen remained with Microsoft until 1983, when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. Though his cancer went into remission a year later with intensive treatment, Allen resigned from the company. Rumors abound as to why Allen left Microsoft. Some say Bill Gates pushed him out, but many say it was a life-changing experience for Allen and he saw there were other opportunities that he could invest his time in. In 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen formed Micro-Soft, a blend of \"micro-computer\" and \"software\" (they dropped the hyphen to Microsoft within a year). Although the company started out on shaky footing, by 1979 Microsoft was grossing approximately $2.5 million, and, at the age of 23, Gates placed himself as the head of the company. With his acumen for software development and a keen business sense, he led the company and worked as its spokesperson. Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, often rewriting code himself when he saw it necessary.\u00a0 Following the development of software for IBM, between 1979 and 1981 Microsoft's growth exploded. Staff increased from 25 to 128, and revenue shot up from $2.5 million to $16 million. In mid-1981, Gates and Allen incorporated Microsoft, and Gates was appointed president and chairman of the board. Allen was named executive vice president. At first, all was not smooth sailing. Although Microsoft\u2019s BASIC software program for the Altair computer netted the company a fee and royalties, it wasn't meeting their overhead. According to Gates' later account, only about 10 percent of the people using BASIC in the Altair computer had actually paid for it. Microsoft's BASIC software was popular with computer hobbyists, who obtained pre-market copies and were reproducing and distributing them for free. At this time, much of the personal computer enthusiasts were people not in it for the money. They felt the ease of reproduction and distribution allowed them to share software with friends and fellow computer enthusiasts. Bill Gates thought differently. He saw the free distribution of software as stealing, especially when it involved software that was created to be sold. In February 1976, Gates wrote an open letter to computer hobbyists, saying that continued distribution and use of software without paying for it would \"prevent good software from being written.\" In essence, pirating software would discourage developers from investing time and money into creating quality software. The letter was unpopular with computer enthusiasts, but Gates stuck to his beliefs and would use the threat of innovation as a defense when faced with charges of unfair business practices. Gates had an acrimonious relationship with MITS president Ed Roberts, often resulting in shouting matches. The combative Gates clashed with Roberts on software development and the direction of the business. Roberts considered Gates spoiled and obnoxious. In 1977, Roberts sold MITS to another computer company and went back to Georgia to enter medical school and become a doctor.\u00a0 Gates and Allen were on their own. The pair had to sue the new owner of MITS to retain the software rights they had developed for Altair. Microsoft wrote software in different formats for other computer companies, and, at the beginning of 1979, Gates moved the company's operations to Bellevue, Washington, just east of Seattle. Gates was glad to be home again in the Pacific Northwest, and threw himself into his work. All 25 employees of the young company had broad responsibilities for all aspects of the operation, product development, business development and marketing.\u00a0 As the computer industry began to grow, with companies like Apple, Intel and IBM developing hardware and components, Bill was continuously out on the road touting the merits of Microsoft software applications. He often took his mother with him. Mary was highly respected and well connected with her membership on several corporate boards, including IBM's. It was through Mary that Bill Gates met the CEO of IBM. In November 1980, IBM was looking for software that would operate their upcoming personal computer (PC) and approached Microsoft. Legend has it that at the first meeting with Bill Gates someone at IBM mistook him for an office assistant and asked him to serve coffee.\u00a0 Gates did look very young, but he quickly impressed IBM, convincing them that he and his company could meet their needs. The only problem was that Microsoft had not developed the basic operating system that would run IBM's new computers. Not to be stopped, Gates bought an operating system that was developed to run on computers similar to IBM's PC. He made a deal with the software's developer, making Microsoft the exclusive licensing agent and later full owner of the software but not telling them of the IBM deal. The company later sued Microsoft and Gates for withholding important information. Microsoft settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, but neither Gates nor Microsoft admitted to any wrongdoing. Gates had to adapt the newly purchased software to work for the IBM PC. He delivered it for a $50,000 fee, the same price he had paid for the software in its original form. IBM wanted to buy the source code, which would have given them the information to the operating system. Gates refused, instead proposing that IBM pay a licensing fee for copies of the software sold with their computers. Doing this allowed Microsoft to license the software they called MS-DOS to any other PC manufacturer, should other computer companies clone the IBM PC, which they soon did. Microsoft also released software called Softcard, which allowed Microsoft BASIC to operate on Apple II machines. By 1983, Microsoft was going global with offices in Great Britain and Japan, and with 30 percent of the world's computers running on its software.\u00a0 Though their rivalry is legend, Microsoft and Apple shared many of their early innovations. In 1981, Apple, at the time led by Steve Jobs, invited Microsoft to help develop software for Macintosh computers. Some developers were involved in both Microsoft development and the development of Microsoft applications for Macintosh. The collaboration could be seen in some shared names between the Microsoft and Macintosh systems.\u00a0 It was through this knowledge sharing that Microsoft was to develop Windows, a system that used a mouse to drive a graphic interface, displaying text and images on the screen. This differed greatly from the text-and-keyboard driven MS-DOS system where all text formatting showed on the screen as code and not what actually would be printed. Bill Gates quickly recognized the threat this kind of software might pose for MS-DOS and Microsoft overall. For the unsophisticated user\u2014which was most of the buying public\u2014the graphic imagery of the competing VisiCorp software used in a Macintosh system would be so much easier to use.\u00a0 Gates announced in an advertising campaign that a new Microsoft operating system was about to be developed that would use a graphic interface. It was to be called \"Windows,\" and would be compatible with all PC software products developed on the MS-DOS system. The announcement was a bluff, in that Microsoft had no such program under development. But as a marketing tactic it was sheer genius, as nearly 30 percent of the computer market was using the MS-DOS system and would wait for Windows software rather than change to a new system. Without people willing to change formats, software developers were unwilling to write programs for the VisiCorp system and it lost momentum by early 1985. In November 1985, nearly two years after his announcement, Bill Gates and Microsoft launched Windows. Visually the Windows system looked very similar to the Macintosh system Apple Computer Corporation had introduced nearly two years earlier. Apple had earlier given Microsoft full access to their technology while it was working on making Microsoft products compatible for Apple computers. Gates had advised Apple to license their software but they ignored the advice, being more interested in selling computers.\u00a0 Once again, Gates took full advantage of the situation and created a software format that was strikingly similar to the Macintosh. Apple threatened to sue, and Microsoft retaliated, saying it would delay shipment of its Microsoft-compatible software for Macintosh users. In the end, Microsoft prevailed in the courts because it could prove that while there were similarities in how the two software systems operated, each individual function was distinctly different. Bill Gates' intelligence allowed him to be able to see all sides of the software industry\u2014product development and corporate strategy. When analyzing any corporate move, he would develop a profile of all the possible cases and run through them, asking questions about anything that could possibly happen.\u00a0 Despite the success of Microsoft, Bill Gates never felt totally secure. Always looking over his shoulder to check on the competition, Gates developed a white-hot drive and competitive spirit. Gates expected everyone in the company to have the same dedication. Gates' assistant reported coming to work early to find someone sleeping under a desk. She considered calling security or the police, until she discovered it was Gates. His confrontational management style also became legend, as he would challenge employees and their ideas to keep the creative process going. An unprepared presenter could hear, \"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\" from Gates. But this was as much a test of the rigor of the employee as it was Gates' passion for his company. He was constantly checking the people around him to see if they were really convinced of their ideas. Outside the company, Bill Gates was gaining a reputation as a ruthless competitor. Several tech companies, led by IBM, began to develop their own operating system, called OS/2, to replace MS-DOS. Rather than give in to the pressure, Gates pushed ahead with the Windows software, improving its operation and expanding its uses. In 1989, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Office, which bundled office productivity applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel into one system that was compatible with all Microsoft products. The applications were not as easily compatible with OS/2. Microsoft's new version of Windows sold 100,000 copies in just two weeks, and OS/2 soon faded away. This left Microsoft with a virtual monopoly on operating systems for PCs. Soon the Federal Trade Commission began to investigate Microsoft for unfair marketing practices. Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft faced a string of Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department investigations. Some related allegations that Microsoft made unfair deals with computer manufacturers who installed the Windows operating system on their computers. Other charges involved Microsoft forcing computer manufactures to sell Microsoft's Internet Explorer as a condition for selling the Windows operating system with their computers. At one point, Microsoft faced a possible break up of its two divisions\u2014operating systems and software development. Microsoft defended itself, harking back to Bill Gates' earlier battles with software piracy and proclaiming that such restrictions were a threat to innovation. Eventually, Microsoft was able to find a settlement with the federal government to avoid a breakup.\u00a0 Through it all, Gates found some inventive ways to deflect the pressure with lighthearted commercials and public appearances at computer trade shows during which he posed as Star Trek's Mr. Spock. Gates continued to run the company and weather the federal investigations through the 1990s. In addition to being one of the richest and most successful businessmen in the history of the world, Bill Gates has also received numerous awards for philanthropic work. Time magazine named Gates one of the most influential people of the 20th century. The magazine also named Gates and his wife Melinda, along with rock band U2's lead singer, Bono, as the 2005 Persons of the Year. Gates holds several honorary doctorates from universities throughout the world. He was knighted as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.\u00a0 In 2006, Gates and his wife were awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle by the Mexican government for their philanthropic work throughout the world in the areas of health and education. In 2016, Gates and his wife Melinda were recognized for their philanthropic work when they were named recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.

            "content": "Bill Gates has committed his fortune to moving the world beyond fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. In his offices overlooking Lake Washington, just east of Seattle, Bill Gates grabbed a legal pad recently and began covering it in his left-handed scrawl. He scribbled arrows by each margin of the pad, both pointing inward. The arrow near the left margin, he said, represented how governments worldwide could stimulate ingenuity to combat climate change by dramatically increasing spending on research and development. \u201cThe push is the R&D,\u201d he said, before indicating the arrow on the right. \u201cThe pull is the carbon tax.\u201d Between the arrows he sketched boxes to represent areas, such as deployment of new technology, where, he argued, private investors should foot the bill. He has pledged to commit $2 billion himself. \u201cYes, the government will be somewhat inept,\u201d he said brusquely, swatting aside one objection as a trivial statement of the obvious. \u201cBut the private sector is in general inept. How many companies do venture capitalists invest in that go poorly? By far most of them.\u201d Bill Gates's First Job Gates is on a solo global lobbying campaign to press his species to accomplish something on a scale it has never attempted before. He wants human beings to invent their way out of the coming collision with planetary climate change, accelerating a transition to new forms of energy that might normally take a century or more. To head off a rise in average global temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels\u2014the goal set by international agreement\u2014Gates believes that by 2050, wealthy nations like China and the United States, the most prodigious belchers of greenhouse gases, must be adding no more carbon to the skies. Those who study energy patterns say we are in a gradual transition from oil and coal to natural gas, a fuel that emits far less carbon but still contributes to global warming. Gates thinks that we can\u2019t accept this outcome, and that our best chance to vault over natural gas to a globally applicable, carbon-free source of energy is to drive innovation \u201cat an unnaturally high pace.\u201d When I sat down to hear his case a few weeks ago, he didn\u2019t evince much patience for the argument that American politicians couldn\u2019t agree even on whether climate change is real, much less on how to combat it. \u201cIf you\u2019re not bringing math skills to the problem,\u201d he said with a sort of amused asperity, \u201cthen representative democracy is a problem.\u201d What follows is a condensed transcript of his remarks, lightly edited for clarity. On whether new commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions expected at the United Nations climate-change conference in Paris in December mean the world is now serious about the problem: It\u2019s good to have people making commitments. It\u2019s really good. But if you really look at those commitments\u2014which are not binding, but even if you say they will all be achieved\u2014they fall dramatically short of the reductions required to reduce CO2 emissions enough to prevent a scenario where global temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius. I mean, these commitments won\u2019t even be a third of what you need. And one of the interesting things about this problem is, if you have a country that says, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to get on a pathway for an 80 percent reduction in CO2 by 2050,\u201d it might make a commitment that \u201cHey, by 2030, we\u2019ll be at 30 percent reduction.\u201d But that first 30 percent is dramatically, dramatically easier than getting to 80 percent. So everything that\u2019s hard has been saved for post-2030\u2014and even these 2030 commitments aren\u2019t enough. And many of them won\u2019t be achieved. On why the free market won\u2019t develop new forms of energy fast enough:  Well, there\u2019s no fortune to be made. Even if you have a new energy source that costs the same as today\u2019s and emits no CO2, it will be uncertain compared with what\u2019s tried-and-true and already operating at unbelievable scale and has gotten through all the regulatory problems, like \u201cOkay, what do you do with coal ash?\u201d and \u201cHow do you guarantee something is safe?\u201d Without a substantial carbon tax, there\u2019s no incentive for innovators or plant buyers to switch. And for energy as a whole, the incentive to invest is quite limited, because unlike digital products\u2014where you get very rapid adoption and so, within the period that your trade secret stays secret or your patent gives you a 20-year exclusive, you can reap incredible returns\u2014almost everything that\u2019s been invented in energy was invented more than 20 years before it got scaled usage. So if you go back to various energy innovators, actually, they didn\u2019t do that well financially. The rewards to society of these energy advances\u2014not much of that is captured by the individual innovator, because it\u2019s a very conservative market. So the R&D amount in energy is surprisingly low compared with medicine or digital stuff, where both the government spending and the private-sector spending is huge. On the pace of energy transitions historically: What\u2019s amazing is how our intense energy usage is one and the same as modern civilization. That is, for all the great things that happened in terms of human lifestyle, life span, and growing food before 1800, civilization didn\u2019t change dramatically until we started using coal in the U.K. in the 1800s. Coal replaced wood. But the wave of wood to coal is about a 50- or 60-year wave. If it was just about economics, if we had no global warming to think about, the slowly-but-surely pace of these transitions would be okay. If you look at one of these forecasts, they all say about the same thing: What you look at is a picture that\u2019s pretty gradual, with natural gas continuing to gain at the expense of both coal and oil. But, you know, 1-percent-a year-type change. If you look at that from a greenhouse-gas point of view\u2014if you look at forecasts\u2014every single year we\u2019ll be emitting more greenhouse gases than the previous year. On whether we\u2019ve ever done anything as big, as a species, as what he\u2019s asking for now: Well, sort of no. Because the scale of it is very big. People can talk about the Manhattan Project during World War II\u2014the challenge of \u201cHey, should we get a nuclear weapon before, potentially, the Japanese or Germans do?\u201d The speed of innovation there really was mind-blowing. And they had to find two paths to get there. One was enriching uranium; the other was breeding plutonium. And, in fact, the first bomb was a uranium bomb; the second bomb was plutonium. Both paths gave them what they\u2019d hoped for. So there\u2019s some amazing things\u2014people look at the digital realm and see the pace of innovation. And that does kind of spoil you, because you can just put something up on the Web, and a hundred million people can download it. But what we\u2019re asking ourselves to do here is change energy\u2014and that includes all of transport, all of electricity, all of household usage, and all of industrial usage. And those are all huge areas of usage. And somebody\u2019ll say to you, \u201cWell, hey, lighting, LED technology, is going to reduce energy consumption from lighting by over half.\u201d That\u2019s true; it\u2019s a miracle, it\u2019s fantastic. But unfortunately, there\u2019s no equivalent in many of these other things, like making fertilizer or making electricity in a general sense. There\u2019s opportunities to conserve that are really good. But the world is going to consume much more energy 30 years from now than it does today. On whether we should all be driving electric cars: People think, Oh, well, I\u2019ll just get an electric car. There are places where if you buy an electric car, you\u2019re actually increasing CO2 emissions, because the electricity infrastructure is emitting more CO2 than you would have if you\u2019d had a gasoline-powered car. On what it will take to accelerate the transition from carbon-emitting energy: When people viewed cancer as a problem, the U.S. government\u2014and it\u2019s a huge favor to the world\u2014declared a war on cancer, and now we fund all health research at about $30 billion a year, of which about $5 billion goes to cancer. We got serious and did a lot of R&D, and then we got the private sector involved in taking that R&D and building breakthrough drugs. In energy, no government\u2014including the U.S., which is in almost every category the big R&D funder\u2014has really made a dramatic increase. It was increased somewhat under Carter and then cut back under Reagan, and it\u2019s now about $6 billion a year\u2014that\u2019s the U.S. piece, which, compared with the importance to our economy in general, is too low. Realistically, we may not get more than a doubling in government funding of energy R&D\u2014but I would love to see a tripling, to $18 billion a year from the U.S. government to fund basic research alone. Now, as a percentage of the government budget, that\u2019s not gigantic. But we are at a time when the flexibility\u2014because of health costs and other things, but primarily health costs\u2014of the budget is very, very squeezed. But you could do a few-percent tax on all of energy consumption, or you could use the general revenue. This is not an unachievable amount of money. On why, considering the level of debate in the presidential campaign, he thinks this kind of investment is imaginable: Well, the success of the United States in medical research is really incredible. I mean, it\u2019s phenomenal. We spend $30 billion a year of government money, and the private sector goes out and comes up with new drugs. It\u2019s an industry that the U.S. is by far the leader in\u2014creating wonderful jobs, great miracle cures\u2014and that is working super, super well, but we spend more than all other countries put together. And the U.S. lead in health technologies, including drugs, is gigantic, just like the U.S. lead in digital technologies is gigantic. In the case of the digital technologies, the path back to government R&D is a bit more complex, because nowadays most of the R&D has moved to the private sector. But the original Internet comes from the government, the original chip-foundry stuff comes from the government\u2014and even today there\u2019s some government money taking on some of the more advanced things and making sure the universities have the knowledge base that maintains that lead. So I\u2019d say the overall record for the United States on government R&D is very, very good. Now, in the case of climate change, because there\u2019s so many possible solutions, it\u2019s not like the Manhattan Project. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s saying, \u201cHey, pick just one approach, and pick some ranch in New Mexico, and just have those guys kind of hang out there.\u201d Here, we want to give a little bit of money to the guy who thinks that high wind will work; we want to give a little bit of money to the guy who thinks that taking sunlight and making oil directly out of sunlight will work. So there\u2019s dozens of those ideas, and there\u2019s enabling technologies for those ideas. That\u2019s the kind of thing that we should be funding more of. On the limits of wind power and solar photovoltaic cells: Wind has grown super-fast, on a very subsidized basis. Solar, off a smaller base, has been growing even faster\u2014again on a highly subsidized basis. But it\u2019s absolutely fair to say that even the modest R&D that\u2019s been done, and the various deployment incentives that are there, have worked well. Now, unfortunately, solar photovoltaic is still not economical, but the biggest problem of all is this intermittency. That is, we need energy 24 hours a day. So, putting aside hydro\u2014which unfortunately can\u2019t grow much\u2014the primary new zero-CO2 sources are intermittent. Now, nuclear is a non-CO2 source, but it\u2019s had its own problems in terms of costs, big safety problems, making sure you can deal with the waste, making sure the plutonium isn\u2019t used to make weapons. So my view is that the biggest problem for the two lead candidates is that storage looks to be so difficult. It\u2019s kind of ironic: Germany, by installing so much rooftop solar, has it that both their coal plants and their rooftop solar are available in the summer, and the price of power during the day actually goes negative\u2014they pay people to take it. Then at night the only source is the coal, and because the energy companies have to recover their capital costs, they either raise the price because they\u2019re not getting any return for the day, or they slowly go bankrupt. There are many people working on storage\u2014batteries are a form of storage, and there\u2019s a few others, like compressed air, hot metals. But it\u2019s not at all clear that we will get grid-scale economic storage. We\u2019re more than a factor of 10 away from the economics to get that. On the self-defeating claims of some clean-energy enthusiasts: They have this statement that the cost of solar photovoltaic is the same as hydrocarbon\u2019s. And that\u2019s one of those misleadingly meaningless statements. What they mean is that at noon in Arizona, the cost of that kilowatt-hour is the same as a hydrocarbon kilowatt-hour. But it doesn\u2019t come at night, it doesn\u2019t come after the sun hasn\u2019t shone, so the fact that in that one moment you reach parity, so what? The reading public, when they see things like that, they underestimate how hard this thing is. So false solutions like divestment or \u201cOh, it\u2019s easy to do\u201d hurt our ability to fix the problems. Distinguishing a real solution from a false solution is actually very complicated. On the role of private investors: I think dozens and dozens of approaches should be funded at the R&D level, and then people like myself, who can afford to take big risks with start-up companies, should\u2014because of climate change\u2014be willing to put some number of billions into the spin-offs that will come out of that government-funded activity. You can\u2019t expect that it will be like a digital thing. So you do have to bring a more patient investor, and even a lower return threshold, to this than to other things. People often talk about, \u201cWell, the solution that gets us beyond the CO2-based energy economy will be a mix of things.\u201d And it will be a mix\u2014but a few will be very big. And so the companies that find whatever turns out to be the mainstream, they will do super, super well. But there won\u2019t be as many successes here as there are in an area like software, where there\u2019s a lot more variety. On why energy is a global challenge: People can always say, \u201cWell, my country is such a small part of it\u2014why should I make the sacrifice? Because I don\u2019t know for sure that the other countries are going to do their part of it.\u201d We don\u2019t have a world government. Fortunately, we don\u2019t have that many world problems\u2014most problems can be solved locally\u2014but this one is a world problem. Carbon is not a local pollutant. It mixes in the global atmosphere in a matter of days. So it doesn\u2019t really matter whether it\u2019s a coal plant in China or a coal plant in the U.S.\u2014the heating effect for the entire globe is the same. On the dangerous certainty of environmentalists: The heating levels have not tracked the climate models exactly, and the skeptics have had a heyday with that. It\u2019s all within the error-bar range. To me, it\u2019s pretty clear that there\u2019s nothing that relieves this as a big problem. But when people act like we have this great certainty, they somewhat undermine the credibility. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in this, but on both the good and the bad side. By overclaiming, or even trying to ascribe current things more to climate change than to other effects, environmentalists lend weight to the skeptics. Like, in the near term, the Pacific oscillation, this El Ni\u00f1o thing, has a much bigger impact on current weather than climate change has had so far. Now, climate change keeps climbing all the time\u2014it just keeps summing, summing, summing, and adding up. So, as you get up to 2050, 2080, 2100, its effect overwhelms the Pacific oscillation. So we have to have dramatic change here. It\u2019s unprecedented to move this quickly, to change an infrastructure of this scale\u2014it\u2019s really unprecedented. And, when you turn to India and say, \u201cPlease cut your carbon emissions, and do it with energy that\u2019s really expensive, subsidized energy,\u201d that\u2019s really putting them in a tough position, because energy for them means a kid can read at night, or having an air conditioner or a refrigerator, or being able to eat fresh foods, or get to your job, or buy fertilizer. That\u2019s why we really need to solve that dilemma, we need innovation that gives us energy that\u2019s cheaper than today\u2019s hydrocarbon energy, that has zero CO2 emissions, and that\u2019s as reliable as today\u2019s overall energy system. And when you put all those requirements together, we need an energy miracle. That may make it seem too daunting to people, but in science, miracles are happening all the time. On the central role of rich countries: I\u2019m a big believer in foreign aid, but the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they\u2019ll make it cheap enough for everyone else. But the big numbers are all in the developed economies, where China\u2019s defined into that term. On whether he\u2019s really read all 36 books by Vaclav Smil, his favorite author and a leading scholar of the history of energy use: I have read all of Smil. There\u2019s a book about the transition of the Japanese diet. I don\u2019t recommend it. On the limitations of a campaign to force university endowments and other funds to divest from fossil-fuel companies: If you think divestment alone is a solution, I worry you\u2019re taking whatever desire people have to solve this problem and kind of using up their idealism and energy on something that won\u2019t emit less carbon\u2014because only a few people in society are the owners of the equity of coal or oil companies. As long as there\u2019s no carbon tax and that stuff is legal, everybody should be able to drive around. So I\u2019ve been saying, \u201cHey, come on\u2014broaden your message to be pro\u2013R&D.\u201d And even the same people who are divesting those stocks of energy companies, ideally some of that money would come into this pool that is funding these high-risk innovations. And so that\u2019s a message that I\u2019ve started to get out. I don\u2019t know if that will be successful. On the surprising wisdom of government R&D: When I first got into this I thought, How well does the Department of Energy spend its R&D budget? And I was worried: Gosh, if I\u2019m going to be saying it should double its budget, if it turns out it\u2019s not very well spent, how am I going to feel about that? But as I\u2019ve really dug into it, the DARPA money is very well spent, and the basic-science money is very well spent. The government has these \u201cCenters of Excellence.\u201d They should have twice as many of those things, and those things should get about four times as much money as they do. Yes, the government will be somewhat inept\u2014but the private sector is in general inept. How many companies do venture capitalists invest in that go poorly? By far most of them. And it\u2019s just that every once in a while a Google or a Microsoft comes out, and some medium-scale successes too, and so the overall return is there, and so people keep giving them money. On why he thinks Congress may not be hopeless: The U.S. Congress does support solar and wind subsidies, which have been quite generous. So Congress isn\u2019t completely absent on this. The House actually passed a climate-change bill [in 2009], when it was a Democratic Congress. There\u2019s a class of voters who care about this, that I think both parties should want to compete for. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hopeless, because it\u2019s about American innovation, American jobs, American leadership, and there are examples where this has gone very, very well. On the centrality of government to progress on energy, historically: Everyone likes to argue about how much the shale-gas boom was driven by the private sector versus government; there was some of both. Nuclear: huge amount of government. Hydropower: mind-blowingly government\u2014because permitting those things, those big reservoirs and everything, you can\u2019t be a private-sector guy betting that you\u2019re going to get permitted. People think energy is more of a private-sector thing than it is. If you go back to Edison\u2019s time, there wasn\u2019t much government funding. There were rich people funding him. Since World War II, U.S.-government R&D has defined the state of the art in almost every area. But energy moves really slowly. There\u2019s this thing Vaclav Smil says: If Edison were reborn today, he would find our batteries completely understandable, because it\u2019s just chemistry. He would say, \u201cOh, cool, you found lithium, that was nice.\u201d Nuclear-power plants, he would go, \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d That, he would be impressed with. And chips, which we can use for managing data and stuff, he\u2019d be impressed with. But he could visit a coal plant and say, \u201cOkay, you scaled it up.\u201d He would visit a natural-gas plant and that would look pretty normal to him; he would look at an internal-combustion engine and he wouldn\u2019t be that surprised. On his faith in human ingenuity: If you told me that innovation had been frozen and we just have today\u2019s technologies, will the world run the climate-change experiment? You bet we will. We will not deny India coal plants; we will run the scary experiment of heating up the atmosphere and see what happens. The only reason I\u2019m optimistic about this problem is because of innovation. And innovation is a very uncertain process. For all I know, even if we don\u2019t up the R&D, 10 years from now some guy will invent something and it\u2019ll take care of this thing. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very likely, but nobody has a predictor function of innovation\u2014which is weird, because the whole modern economy and our lifestyles are an accumulation of innovations. So I want to tilt the odds in our favor by driving innovation at an unnaturally high pace, or more than its current business-as-usual course. I see that as the only thing. I want to call up India someday and say, \u201cHere\u2019s a source of energy that is cheaper than your coal plants, and by the way, from a global-pollution and local-pollution point of view, it\u2019s also better.\u201d I think if we don\u2019t get that in the next 15 years, then as much as people care about this thing, we will at least run the 2-degree experiment. Then there\u2019s the question of \u201cOkay, do we run the 3-degree experiment? Do we run the 4-degree experiment?\u201d      The San Francisco columbarium plays host to the remains and memories of thousands of the city's deceased residents. Legal experts said Monday's revelations show the special counsel is \u201cmaximizing the clout\u201d of the Russia investigation. Updated at 5:04 p.m.With the release of his first indictments and a surprise plea deal on Monday morning, Special Counsel Robert Mueller sketched a partial outline of his team\u2019s investigation into Russian electoral meddling and took control of a news narrative that had been increasingly dominated by his conservative critics. Legal experts said the court filings indicate Mueller is running a serious, deliberative, and far-sighted inquiry. \u201cI would say this is High-Level Special Counsel Investigation 101,\u201d said Richard Ben-Veniste, a member of the Watergate special-prosecutor task force. \u201cMueller is operating by the book.\u201d The first wave of charges came against two top Trump campaign officials, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates. Their indictment describes a conspiracy to evade taxes and launder at least $75 million of foreign income into the United States from offshore accounts. According to the special counsel\u2019s office, Manafort used the money to \u201cenjoy a lavish lifestyle\u201d by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on expensive suits, antique rugs, and other luxuries. Usually, laying low during controversies is a savvy move for legislators. But when it comes to Trump and Russia, it brings its own risks. \u201cSenator, I wonder if I could get a comment \u2026 \" Click. That little scene is being enacted in one form or another across Washington on Monday, following the indictments of three former Trump campaign officials. Reporters are seeking comment from Republican officeholders. Republican officeholders are desperately eluding reporters, conforming to the maxim often attributed to Calvin Coolidge, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain what you never said.\u201d Yet what is usually good advice can become, when it fails, spectacularly bad advice. Today is such a day. The advice I want to offer here is not directed to the brave senator or the principled senator. It is directed to the run-of-the-mill senator\u2014the prudent senator, the self-preserving senator. If you keep quiet today, you are putting yourself in jeopardy. Events are about to start moving very fast, and if you miss this moment, you will find yourself carried along by those events to places where it is not healthy for you to travel. Whatever else Monday\u2019s indictments revealed, they confirm that the president exercised extraordinarily poor judgment in staffing his campaign. Monday\u2019s double blockbuster from Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation\u2014indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and a plea deal with George Papadopoulos\u2014is at once an enormous advance in the story and highly unsatisfying. While these are important milestones in the probe, their import on the most interesting question, of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, is opaque. For the time being, however, there\u2019s one clear takeaway: Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, and George Papadopoulos should have never been anywhere near a major presidential campaign, and their hiring reinforces concerns about President Trump\u2019s judgment. Trump is not a policy expert, and although he occasionally boasted that he would learn what he needed on the job, his real sell to voters was that he would be an effective manager and dealmaker. For the details, he promised repeatedly, he would hire the best people. Instead, his campaign empowered a pair of aides who, according to prosecutors, were years into a $75 million money-laundering scheme, and named a foreign-policy aide with little experience who fancied himself a savvy global operator. The reasons why Manafort, Gates, and Papadopoulos were disastrously unwise picks were different, although they are all converging in the special counsel\u2019s investigation. After years of silence on his sexual orientation, Kevin Spacey issued a bizarre statement on \u201cchoosing to live as a gay man\u201d while apologizing for alleged child molestation. Late Sunday night, the comedian Billy Eichner wrote on Twitter, \u201cKevin Spacey has just invented something that has never existed before: a bad time to come out.\u201d After years of declining to talk about his sexual orientation, Spacey hurled it out in no uncertain terms as part of a public statement: \u201cI choose now to live as a gay man.\u201d Eyebrows may have been raised by the contentious phrasing\u2014the history of the idea of choice in sexual orientation being loaded. But many eyebrows were already fully raised by the fact that this sentence came after a half-apology for an alleged 1986 child molestation. The incident involved actor Anthony Rapp, then 14 years old. BuzzFeed published the allegation Sunday night, and Spacey\u2019s statement followed less than three hours later. He claimed no recollection of the evening in question, but wrote, \u201cI owe [Rapp] the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.\u201d More comfortable online than out partying, post-Millennials are safer, physically, than adolescents have ever been. But they\u2019re on the brink of a mental-health crisis. One day last summer, around noon, I called Athena, a 13-year-old who lives in Houston, Texas. She answered her phone\u2014she\u2019s had an iPhone since she was 11\u2014sounding as if she\u2019d just woken up. We chatted about her favorite songs and TV shows, and I asked her what she likes to do with her friends. \u201cWe go to the mall,\u201d she said. \u201cDo your parents drop you off?,\u201d I asked, recalling my own middle-school days, in the 1980s, when I\u2019d enjoy a few parent-free hours shopping with my friends. \u201cNo\u2014I go with my family,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll go with my mom and brothers and walk a little behind them. I just have to tell my mom where we\u2019re going. I have to check in every hour or every 30 minutes.\u201d Those mall trips are infrequent\u2014about once a month. More often, Athena and her friends spend time together on their phones, unchaperoned. Unlike the teens of my generation, who might have spent an evening tying up the family landline with gossip, they talk on Snapchat, the smartphone app that allows users to send pictures and videos that quickly disappear. They make sure to keep up their Snapstreaks, which show how many days in a row they have Snapchatted with each other. Sometimes they save screenshots of particularly ridiculous pictures of friends. \u201cIt\u2019s good blackmail,\u201d Athena said. (Because she\u2019s a minor, I\u2019m not using her real name.) She told me she\u2019d spent most of the summer hanging out alone in her room with her phone. That\u2019s just the way her generation is, she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice to know any life without iPads or iPhones. I think we like our phones more than we like actual people.\u201d Some people who have to be responsible for their siblings or parents as children grow up to be compulsive caretakers. Laura Kiesel was only 6 years old when she became a parent to her infant brother. At home, his crib was placed directly next to her bed, so that when he cried at night, she was the one to pick him up and sing him back to sleep. She says she was also in charge of changing his diapers and making sure he was fed every day. For the majority of her early childhood, she remembers, she tended to his needs while her own mother was in the depths of heroin addiction. From as early as she can remember, Kiesel says she had to take care of herself\u2014preparing her own meals, clothing herself, and keeping herself entertained. At school, she remembers becoming a morose and withdrawn child whose hair was often dirty and unkempt. George Papadopoulos heard that Russia had \"dirt\" related to Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands\" of hacked emails as early as April 2016. Updated at 4:54 p.m. ET Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election has notched its first guilty plea\u2014but the culprit isn\u2019t one of the bigger names in the case. George Papadopoulos, an obscure, low-level foreign-policy aide to the Donald Trump presidential campaign, pleaded guilty on October 5 to making false statements to the FBI. Papadopoulos doesn\u2019t have the same profile as Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chair whose indictment was unsealed on Monday, but the case against him offers new information about possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. According to a government filing, all of which Papadopoulos acknowledged to be accurate as part of the plea deal, he learned in March 2016 that he would be joining the Trump campaign as a foreign-policy adviser. Later that month, he met in Italy with an individual identified as \u201cthe Professor,\u201d who claimed to have extensive Russian government connections, and who took interest in his new job. The Professor in turn introduced Papadopoulos to a Russian woman who claimed to be a relative of Russian President Vladimir Putin, though Papadopoulos later learned she was not. Papadopoulos told Trump campaign officials about his contacts with the pair and received encouragement. Congressional testimony that illuminates what a developmental disability means\u2014and doesn\u2019t mean Last week, the actor, Special Olympian, and advocate Frank Stephens gave this testimony to Congress: \u201cI am a man with Down syndrome and my life is worth living.\u201d In fact, he went farther: \u201cI have a great life!\u201d For those conceived with his developmental disability, it is the best and worst of times. \u201cThe life expectancy for someone born with Down syndrome has increased from twenty-five in the early 1980s to more than fifty today,\u201d Caitrin Keiper writes in The New Atlantis. \u201cIn many other ways as well, a child born with Down syndrome today has brighter prospects than at any other point in history. Early intervention therapies, more inclusive educational support, legal protections in the workplace, and programs for assisted independent living offer a full, active future in the community.\u201d The prosecution of Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman and his associate Rick Gates could be the most significant prosecution under the Foreign Agents Registration Act ever. The indictment of Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates on Monday is, among many other things, the most significant prosecution of a Foreign Agents Registration Act violation ever. Manafort and Gates have been charged with a litany of federal crimes including conspiracy against the United States and tax fraud. They\u2019re also accused of having acted as agents of a foreign power\u2014in this case, the Ukrainian government under the pro-Russia former president Viktor Yanukovych\u2014without registering their activities with the Department of Justice, as is required by law under FARA. The DOJ\u2019s FARA unit is small, and the law is easy to skirt or violate and get away with it, and it\u2019s commonplace on K Street to do so. This is why the possibility that Manafort and Gates could go to prison for violating FARA \u00a0could have reverberations across the lobbying world. In the hypercompetitive world of higher education, many academics who face sexual harassment remain silent to avoid forfeiting a promotion or research gig. His career was too important. Despite allegations of sexual harassment that were substantiated by an internal investigation, the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law allowed Dean Sujit Choudhry to stay on the job. In 2015, Tyann Sorrell, Choudhry\u2019s assistant, described how the dean had pursued her for kisses and long hugs over a period of months. Choudhry initially held onto his professorship and benefits. Even after an uproar, the university, which boasts a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, kept him on payroll (he was pushed to resign as dean after Sorrell sued him for sexual harassment in 2016, but he remained on the law-school faculty). Choudhry was eventually put on a two-year sabbatical, still retaining travel funding and research grants (the settlement reached between Sorrell, Choudhry, and the school ensures that he will voluntarily resign in 2018).

            "content": "Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Robots are taking human jobs. But Bill Gates believes that governments should tax companies\u2019 use of them, as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment. It\u2019s a striking position from the world\u2019s richest man and a self-described techno-optimist who co-founded Microsoft, one of the leading players in artificial-intelligence technology. In a recent interview with Quartz, Gates said that a robot tax could finance jobs taking care of elderly people or working with kids in schools, for which needs are unmet and to which humans are particularly well suited. He argues that governments must oversee such programs rather than relying on businesses, in order to redirect the jobs to help people with lower incomes. The idea is not totally theoretical: EU lawmakers considered a proposal to tax robot owners to pay for training for workers who lose their jobs, though on Feb. 16 the legislators ultimately rejected it. \u201cYou ought to be willing to raise the tax level and even slow down the speed\u201d of automation, Gates argues. That\u2019s because the technology and business cases for replacing humans in a wide range of jobs are arriving simultaneously, and it\u2019s important to be able to manage that displacement. \u201cYou cross the threshold of job replacement of certain activities all sort of at once,\u201d Gates says, citing warehouse work and driving as some of the job categories that in the next 20 years will have robots doing them. You can watch Gates\u2019 remarks in the video above. Below is a transcript, lightly edited for style and clarity. Quartz: What do you think of a robot tax? This is the idea that in order to generate funds for training of workers, in areas such as manufacturing, who are displaced by automation, one concrete thing that governments could do is tax the installation of a robot in a factory, for example. Bill Gates: Certainly there will be taxes that relate to automation. Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things. If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you\u2019d think that we\u2019d tax the robot at a similar level. And what the world wants is to take this opportunity to make all the goods and services we have today, and free up labor, let us do a better job of reaching out to the elderly, having smaller class sizes, helping kids with special needs. You know, all of those are things where human empathy and understanding are still very, very unique. And we still deal with an immense shortage of people to help out there. So if you can take the labor that used to do the thing automation replaces, and financially and training-wise and fulfillment-wise have that person go off and do these other things, then you\u2019re net ahead. But you can\u2019t just give up that income tax, because that\u2019s part of how you\u2019ve been funding that level of human workers. And so you could introduce a tax on robots\u2026 There are many ways to take that extra productivity and generate more taxes. Exactly how you\u2019d do it, measure it, you know, it\u2019s interesting for people to start talking about now. Some of it can come on the profits that are generated by the labor-saving efficiency there. Some of it can come directly in some type of robot tax. I don\u2019t think the robot companies are going to be outraged that there might be a tax. It\u2019s OK. Could you figure out a way to do it that didn\u2019t dis-incentivize innovation? Well, at a time when people are saying that the arrival of that robot is a net loss because of displacement, you ought to be willing to raise the tax level and even slow down the speed of that adoption somewhat to figure out, \u201cOK, what about the communities where this has a particularly big impact? Which transition programs have worked and what type of funding do those require?\u201d You cross the threshold of job-replacement of certain activities all sort of at once. So, you know, warehouse work, driving, room cleanup, there\u2019s quite a few things that are meaningful job categories that, certainly in the next 20 years, being thoughtful about that extra supply is a net benefit. It\u2019s important to have the policies to go with that. People should be figuring it out. It is really bad if people overall have more fear about what innovation is going to do than they have enthusiasm. That means they won\u2019t shape it for the positive things it can do. And, you know, taxation is certainly a better way to handle it than just banning some elements of it. But [innovation] appears in many forms, like self-order at a restaurant\u2014what do you call that? There\u2019s a Silicon Valley machine that can make hamburgers without human hands\u2014seriously! No human hands touch the thing. [Laughs] And you\u2019re more on the side that government should play an active role rather than rely on businesses to figure this out? Well, business can\u2019t. If you want to do [something about] inequity, a lot of the excess labor is going to need to go help the people who have lower incomes. And so it means that you can amp up social services for old people and handicapped people and you can take the education sector and put more labor in there. Yes, some of it will go to, \u201cHey, we\u2019ll be richer and people will buy more things.\u201d But the inequity-solving part, absolutely government\u2019s got a big role to play there. The nice thing about taxation though, is that it really separates the issue: \u201cOK, so that gives you the resources, now how do you want to deploy it?\u201d",

Gates is founder, technology advisor and board member of Microsoft Corporation, the worldwide leader in software, services and solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential.\u00a0 He served as chairman of the board until Feb. 4, 2014. On June 27, 2008, Gates transitioned out of a day-to-day role in the company to spend more time on his global health and education work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He shares his thoughts about the foundation and other topics on Gates Notes, a website launched in January 2010. Gates continues to serve on Microsoft\u2019s Board of Directors and as an advisor on key development projects. Born on Oct. 28, 1955, Gates grew up in Seattle with his two sisters. Their father, William H. Gates II, is a Seattle attorney. Their late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way International. Gates attended public elementary school and the private Lakeside School. There, he discovered his interest in software and began programming computers at age 13. In 1973, Gates entered Harvard University as a freshman, where he lived down the hall from Steve Ballmer. While at Harvard, Gates developed a version of the programming language BASIC for the first microcomputer \u2013 the MITS Altair. In his junior year, Gates left Harvard to devote his energies to Microsoft, a company he had begun in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen. Guided by a belief that the computer would be a valuable tool on every office desktop and in every home, they began developing software for personal computers. Gates\u2019 foresight and his vision for personal computing have been central to the success of Microsoft and the software industry. Under Gates\u2019 leadership, Microsoft\u2019s mission has been to continually advance and improve software technology, and to make it easier, more cost-effective and more enjoyable for people to use computers. The company is committed to a long-term view, reflected in its industry-leading investment in research and development each year. In 1999, Gates wrote \u201cBusiness @ the Speed of Thought,\u201d a book that shows how computer technology can solve business problems in fundamentally new ways. The book was published in 25 languages and is available in more than 60 countries. \u201cBusiness @ the Speed of Thought\u201d has received wide critical acclaim, and was listed on the best-seller lists of the \u201cNew York Times,\u201d \u201cUSA Today,\u201d \u201cThe Wall Street Journal\u201d and on Amazon.com. Gates\u2019 previous book, \u201cThe Road Ahead,\u201d published in 1995, was at the top of the \u201cNew York Times\u201d bestseller list for seven weeks. Gates has donated the proceeds of both books to non-profit organizations that support the use of technology in education and skills development. In addition to his love of computers and software, Gates founded Corbis, which is developing one of the world\u2019s largest resources of visual information \u2013 a comprehensive digital archive of art and photography from public and private collections around the globe. He is also a member of the board of directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invests in companies engaged in diverse business activities. Philanthropy is very important to Gates.\u00a0 He and his wife, Melinda, started a foundation in 2000 to help reduce inequities in the United States and around the world.\u00a0 The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation supports philanthropic initiatives in the areas of global health and learning, with the hope that in the 21st century, advances in these critical areas will be available for all people.\u00a0 To learn more about the foundation, visit www.gatesfoundation.org Gates was married on Jan. 1, 1994, to Melinda French Gates. They have three children.

During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[4][a] Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself.[7] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[8] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[9] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[10] Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[11] Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000. Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[12] From 1995 to 2009, he held the title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years, and held it consistently from 2014\u2013July 2017, with an estimated net worth of US$89.9\u00a0billion as of October 2017.[1] However, on July 27, 2017, and since October 27, 2017, he has been surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, who has an estimated net worth of US$93.9\u00a0billion.[13] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[14] The foundation works to save lives and improve global health, and is working with Rotary International to eliminate polio.[15]   Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (b. 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929\u20131994). His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish.[16][17] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates's maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" because his father had the \"II\" suffix.[18] Early on in his life, Gates's parents had a law career in mind for him.[19] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[20][21][22] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that \"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing\".[23] At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school.[24] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.[25] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, \"There was just something neat about the machine.\"[26] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students\u00a0\u2013  Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans\u00a0\u2013  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[27][28] At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype. Subsequently, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with \"a disproportionate number of interesting girls.\"[29] He later stated that \"it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.\"[26] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[30] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.[31] Gates was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.[32] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[33][34] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[35] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO. He maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation from the company in 2014.[36] In his second year, Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[37] presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates's solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years;[37][38] its successor is faster by only one percent.[37] His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[39] While Gates was a student at Harvard,[40] he did not have a definite study plan, and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[41] The MITS Altair 8800 was released the following year. The new computer was based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[42] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much their son wanted to start his own company.[40] Gates explained his decision to leave Harvard, saying \"...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] leave [of absence].\"[43] After Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which demonstrated the Altair 8800, he contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[44] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,[45] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership \"Micro-Soft\" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.[45] Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name \"Microsoft\" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.[45] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies. Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 percent of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair \"hobby market\" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[46] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[45] The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979.[44] During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.[47][unreliable source?] IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating system for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[48] Big Blue first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[49] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.[50] Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.[50] They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[51] Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. PC Magazine asked if Gates were \"the man behind the machine?\",[48] and InfoWorld quoted an expert as stating \"it's Gates' computer\".[52] Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.[44] Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.[53] From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that \"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\"[54] Another executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor.\"[55] Gates was an executive who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[56][57] He interrupted presentations with such comments as \"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\"[58] and \"Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?\"[59] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.[58] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, \"I'll do it over the weekend.\"[60][61][62] During Microsoft's early history, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[63] but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products.[61] He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, \"Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.\"[64] On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that over the next two years he would transition out of his day-to-day role to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[65] Many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates's approval. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as, \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[66] BusinessWeek reported: Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[67] Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, \"Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree.\"[68] Despite Gates's denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[68] In 2008, Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation.[69] As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a \"Yes\", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a \"Yes\". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about \"nothing\" (Seinfeld).[70] In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.[71] Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8\u00a0billion to US$78.5\u00a0billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates's assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[72] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside new CEO Satya Nadella.[10][73] Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: \"... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism.\" Gates also identified innovation as the \"real driver of progress\" and pronounced that \"America's way better today than it's ever been.\"[74] Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of superintelligence; in a Reddit \"ask me anything\", he stated that First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[75][76][77][78] In a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would \"highly recommend\" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[79] Gates's days are planned for him, similar to the US President's schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.[80] Gates married Melinda French on a golf course on the Hawaiian island of Lanai on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002). The family resides in a modern design mansion, which is an earth-sheltered house in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina near Seattle in Washington State, United States. According to 2007 King County public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125\u00a0million, and the annual property taxes are $991,000. The 66,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (6,100\u00a0m2) estate has a 60-foot (18\u00a0m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (230\u00a0m2) gym and a 1,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (93\u00a0m2) dining room.[81] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith: The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.[82] In the same interview, Gates said: \"I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm\u00a0\u2013 not all\u00a0\u2013 that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\"[82] The Codex Leicester is one of Gates's private acquisitions. He purchased the collection of famous scientific writings by Leonardo da Vinci for $30.8\u00a0million at an auction in 1994.[83] Gates is also known for being an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[84] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[85][86] In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101\u00a0billion.[87] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet.[88] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[89] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[90][91] Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014[92][93] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40\u00a0billion to more than US$82\u00a0billion.[94] Since October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.[13] Bill Gates has held the top spot on the list of The World's Billionaires for 18 out of the past 23 years.[95] Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.[96] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[97] In 2016, he was discussing his gaming habits when he revealed that he was color-blind.[98] In a BBC interview, Gates claimed \"I've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so... I've paid over $6 billion in taxes.\"[99] He is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich.[100] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[14] Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the \"William H. Gates Foundation.\" In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6\u00a0billion.[101][102] The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[103][104] Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[105] As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28\u00a0billion to charity;[106] the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.[107] The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[108] The foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat Vitamin A deficiency.[109] Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in The Power of Half.[110] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a commitment they called the \"Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge.\" The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.[111][112][113] Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20\u00a0million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[114] The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[115] Gates also donated $6\u00a0million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[116] On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).[117] Since about 2005, Bill Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the \"Reinvent the Toilet Challenge\", which has received considerable media interest.[118] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was \"produced from human feces\" in 2014\u00a0\u2013 in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni-processor.[119][120] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[121] Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10\u00a0million each as their inheritance. With only $30\u00a0million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.[122] In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell to the developing world.[123] In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[124] It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[125] The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students.[126] The scholarship program is administered by the United Negro College Fund.[127] In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when he decided to donate $50 million to UNAIDS through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[128][129] On April 29, 2017, Bill Gates partnered with Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer in playing a noncompetitive tennis match to a packed house at Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[130] Federer and Gates played against John Isner and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McReady. Gates and Federer won the game 6\u20134. In 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's 400 Richest People in America issue. He was worth $1.25\u00a0billion and was the world's youngest self-made billionaire.[12] Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes The World's Billionaires list and was the wealthiest from 1995 to 1996,[131] 1998 to 2007, 2009, and has been since 2014.[1] Gates was number one on Forbes' 400 Richest Americans list from 1993 through to 2007.[132][needs update] Time magazine named Gates one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th century, as well as one of the 100 most influential people of 2004, 2005, and 2006. Time also collectively named Gates, his wife Melinda and U2's lead singer Bono as the 2005 Persons of the Year for their humanitarian efforts.[133] In 2006, he was voted eighth in the list of \"Heroes of our time\".[134] Gates was listed in the Sunday Times power list in 1999, named CEO of the year by Chief Executive Officers magazine in 1994, ranked number one in the \"Top 50 Cyber Elite\" by Time in 1998, ranked number two in the Upside Elite 100 in 1999, and was included in The Guardian as one of the \"Top 100 influential people in media\" in 2001.[135] According to Forbes, Gates was ranked as the fourth most powerful person in the world in 2012,[136] up from fifth in 2011.[137] In 1994, he was honored as the twentieth Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society. In 1999, Gates received New York Institute of Technology's President's Medal.[138] Gates has received honorary doctorates from Nyenrode Business Universiteit, Breukelen, The Netherlands, in 2000;[139] the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2002;[140] Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2005; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in April 2007;[141] Harvard University in June 2007;[142] the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, in 2007,[143] and Cambridge University in June 2009.[144] He was also made an honorary trustee of Peking University in 2007.[145] Gates was made an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.[146] In November 2006, he was awarded the Placard of the Order of the Aztec Eagle, together with his wife Melinda who was awarded the Insignia of the same order, both for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in Mexico, and specifically in the program \"Un pa\u00eds de lectores\".[147] Gates received the 2010 Bower Award for Business Leadership from The Franklin Institute for his achievements at Microsoft and his philanthropic work.[148] Also in 2010, he was honored with the Silver Buffalo Award by the Boy Scouts of America, its highest award for adults, for his service to youth.[149] Entomologists named Bill Gates's flower fly, Eristalis gatesi, in his honor in 1997.[150] In 2002, Bill and Melinda Gates received the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged.[151] In 2006, Gates received the James C. Morgan Global Humanitarian Award from The Tech Awards.[152] In 2015, Gates, along with his wife Melinda, received the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian award for their social work in the country.[153][154] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Gates and his wife Melinda with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their philanthropic efforts.[155] In 2017, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande awarded Bill and Melinda with the France's highest national award \u2013 Legion of Honour in Paris for their charity efforts.[156] To date, Bill Gates has written two books: In 2013, Gates became a LinkedIn Influencer.[162] Gates was the guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on January 31, 2016, in which he talks about his relationships with his father and Steve Jobs, meeting his then future wife Melinda Ann French, the start of Microsoft and some of his habits (for example reading The Economist \"from cover to cover every week\"). His choice of things to take on a desert island were, for music: \"Blue Skies\" by Willie Nelson; book: The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker; and luxury item: a DVD Collection of Lectures from The Teaching Company.[163]",

            "content": "With $89 (\u00a367bn) billion in the bank, Microsoft founder Bill Gates\u00a0has been\u00a0the world's richest man\u00a0since May 2013.\u00a0 After founding and developing\u00a0one of the most powerful and profitable technology companies in history,\u00a0since 2008 he has\u00a0dedicated his life to charity work\u00a0via\u00a0The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, so far giving away\u00a0$31.1bn. William 'Bill' Henry Gates was born on 28 October 1955, and grew up in a comfortably-off family with his two sisters in Seattle, Washington.\u00a0His father, also called William, is a Seattle attorney and his late mother Mary was a schoolteacher. A deep-thinking child, Gates was educated at the private\u00a0Lakeside School in Seattle where he excelled at many subjects. It was here\u00a0in 1967\u00a0that he had his first encounter with a computer\u00a0and so began the many hours he would spend in the school computer room where,\u00a0he wrote his first computer program aged 13. Gates and his friend Paul Allen became so fascinated by computers that they built a programme based on an\u00a0Intel 8008 chip and used it to analyse traffic data for the Washington state highway department. Gates later won a place at\u00a0Harvard University but dropped out in 1975 to start Microsoft with Allen. In the mid-1970s, when typewriters and carbon paper were commonplace, Gates and\u00a0Allen had a far-fetched vision to have \"a computer on every desktop and in every home.\"\u00a0 Inspired by a magazine article about the world's first microcomputer, the pair started by developing a version of the programming language BASIC for the first microcomputer \u2013 the MITS Altair 8800. They approached MITS with their creation, and the company agreed to distribute it as 'Altair BASIC'. Allen was hired into MITS, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him in Albuquerque, New Mexico in November 1975. They officially established a small\u00a030-man operation called\u00a0\"Micro-Soft\" on 4 April 1975, with Gates as the CEO. Gates never returned to Harvard. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, but continued to develop programming language software for various systems. The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington, on 1 January 1979. During Microsoft's early years, Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit. IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 to provide the operating system for its upcoming personal computer. For this deal, Microsoft bought a system called 86-DOS from a company called Seattle Computer Products and, after adapting it for the PC, delivered it to IBM as 'PC DOS' in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000. However, Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware companies would clone IBM's system. He was right, and the sales of PC DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry. Despite IBM's name on the operating system, Gates was quickly identified as 'the man behind the machine'.\u00a0\u00a0Microsoft's sales subsequently soared from $7 million in 1980 to $16 million in 1981.\u00a0 Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring in June 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates president of Microsoft and the chairman of the board. By this time he had gained a reputation for being distant to others. He met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers, and was reportedly verbally pugnacious, berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies that placed the company's long-term interests at risk. Microsoft launched the first version of its Windows 1.0 operating system in\u00a01985, but critics dubbed it slow and cumbersome. Further problems came when growing rival Apple saw Windows as a rip-off of its much-easier-to-use\u00a0Macintosh operating system and sued - although the courts finally ruled in Microsoft's favour in the mid-1990s. Microsoft moved its headquarters to Redmond in February 1986, and on March 13 the company went public with huge success, turning Gates into one of the wealthiest people in the U.S. In 1987 Gates, aged 31, had become\u00a0the world's youngest billionnaire. As the years rolled on, Gates worked hard to improve Windows and also introduced the top-selling Office suite, which bundled applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. Gates also managed to persuade key computer makers to preload Microsoft's software on every computer it sold. \u00a0By 1993, Windows was estimated to be\u00a0running on almost 85 per cent of the world's computers.\u00a0 Perhaps Gates' biggest regret will be failing to translate Microsoft\u2019s dominance of the desktop to the web. In 1995, Gates wrote a call-to-arms memo to his employees, entitled \u201cThe internet tidal wave\u201d, which claimed that the web was \u201cthe single most important development to come along since the IBM PC.\u201d Microsoft, though, was slow to see the potential of building its own search engine\u00a0and relied on search partners\u00a0such as Inktomi\u00a0for several years. By the time it did launch its own dedicated search platform, it had lost significant ground to Google, not just in the search and advertising space, but also the desktop space. Google offered a host of free online programs, such as Google Docs, that competed directly with the paid-for Office suite. \u201cGoogle kicked our butts,\u201d said Gates in a 2005 interview, when he also branded Microsoft\u2019s decision not to pursue a dedicated search engine from the outset as \u201cstupid as hell\u201d. Microsoft, arguably, is still on the back foot. It wasn't all bad news though. 1995 was the year that Microsoft launched its groundbreaking Windows 1995\u00a0operating system. As well as being a technological breakthrough it was an unprecedented cultural phenomenon, and\u00a0its\u00a0launch became a massive celebrity-backed global event.\u00a0 Features included\u00a0the Start Menu\u00a0and the taskbar, which\u00a0still define Microsoft\u2019s operating system today. The software was also a leap forward in graphic design and was released as home computers were becoming ever more affordable. The launch put Microsoft at the forefront of the home computing revolution and in 1998 it became the world's biggest company.\u00a0 Gates handed over the CEO position of Microsoft in 2000\u00a0to Steve Ballmer, an old college friend and employee of the company since 1980. Allen resigned after a long-term illness, while Gates became 'chief software architect' and chairman of the board. Microsoft went on to release Windows XP in 2001, followed by Windows Vista in 2007, Windows 7 in 2009 and Windows 8 in 2011. It entered the game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo, launching the first Xbox in 2001, and began to take on Apple in the smartphone market with the launch of Windows Phone in 2011, and the purchase of Nokia in 2013. Meanwhile, Gates announced in June 2006 that he would begin transitioning out of his day-to-day role to dedicate more time to philanthropy.\u00a0He finally retired as chief software architect in June 2008, and stepped down as chairman in 2014. He met Melinda French,\u00a0a young woman working at Microsoft, in 1989 and married her in 1994. The couple have three children; Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe.\u00a0 Officially established in 2000, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\u00a0is the largest philanthropic organisation in the world and has been the Gates' main focus since he cut back his role at Microsoft in 2008.\u00a0 As well as funding\u00a0global health\u00a0programmes dedicated to disease prevention, immunisation and vaccination, it also aims to\u00a0reduce extreme poverty, expand educational opportunities and improve access to information technology. In recent years\u00a0Gates has also turned his attention to the environment. In 2006, Warren Buffet donated\u00a0$31 billion, most of his fortune, to the foundation. In 2013, as part of Gates'\u00a0$5.5 billion effort to eradicate polio by 2018,\u00a0India\u00a0was certified polio-free by the World Health Organisation, leaving only three countries that have never been free of the disease. Gates and his wife plan to eventually donate 95 per cent of their wealth to charity. \u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017 We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.

In a filing to the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, Gates revealed he\u2019s donating 64 million shares of Microsoft worth a total of $4.6 billion. It\u2019s a huge donation, and Bloomberg reports that it\u2019s the biggest since he gave away $16 billion worth in 1999 and $5.1 billion of shares in 2000. The SEC filing doesn\u2019t reveal exactly where Bill Gates has donated his Microsoft shares to, but Gates has been on a mission to gift his shares and fund the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a charity set up by him and his wife for their philanthropy. Gates usually donates around 80 million Microsoft shares each year, and this latest gift means he\u2019s left with nearly 103 million shares. The SEC filing also reveals that Melinda Gates holds nearly 425,000 Microsoft shares.  If Gates continues to gift shares like he has in the past, then he could reduce his stake in Microsoft to zero in 2019. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is still the largest holder of Microsoft stock, followed by Gates and then current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.  While the donation is a large amount in monetary terms, Gates still holds the title of richest person in the world. Bloomberg now values Gates at $86.1 billion, down from his previous $90 billion fortune. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is edging closer, though. The billionaire briefly surpassed Gates last month to become the world\u2019s richest person, before falling back behind Gates after Amazon\u2019s share price dropped.

            "content": "Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates (born October 28, 1955) and his partner Paul Allen founded and built the world&apos;s largest software business, Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Gates announced that he was stepping down as Microsoft&apos;s chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In March 1986, Bill Gates took Microsoft public with an initial public offering (IPO) of $21 per share, making him an instant millionaire at age 31. Gates held 45 percent of the company&apos;s 24.7 million shares, making his stake at that time $234 million of Microsoft&apos;s $520 million.\u00a0 Over time, the company&apos;s stock increased in value and split numerous times. In 1987, Bill Gates became a billionaire when the stock hit $90.75 a share. Since then, Gates has been at the top, or at least near the top, of Forbes&apos; annual list of the top 400 wealthiest people in America. In 1999, with stock prices at an all-time high and the stock splitting eight-fold since its IPO, Gates&apos; wealth briefly topped $101 billion. In 1997, Gates and his family moved into a 55,000-square-foot, $54-million house on the shore of Lake Washington. Though the house serves as a business center, it is said to be very cozy for the couple and their three children.\u00a0 In 1987, a 23-year-old Microsoft product manager named Melinda French caught the eye of Bill Gates, then 32. The very bright and organized Melinda was a perfect match for Gates. In time, their relationship grew as they discovered an intimate and intellectual connection. On January 1, 1994, Melinda and Bill were married in Hawaii.\u00a0 Following the devastating death of his mother to breast cancer just a few months after their wedding, Bill and Melinda took some time off in 1995 to travel and get a new perspective on life and the world. In 1996, their first daughter, Jennifer, was born. Their son, Rory, was born in 1999, and a second daughter, Phoebe, arrived in 2002. READ ARTICLE: 7 Fun Facts About Bill Gates. In 1994, Bill and Melinda Gates established the William H. Gates Foundation, which was dedicated to supporting education, world health and investment in low-income communities. With Melinda&apos;s influence, Bill had taken an interest in becoming a civic leader in the footsteps of his mother, studying the philanthropic work of American industrial titans Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. He realized that he had an obligation to give more of his wealth to charity. In 2000, the couple combined several family foundations and made a $28 billion contribution to form the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2000, Bill Gates stepped down from the day-to-day operations of Microsoft, turning over the job of CEO to college friend Steve Ballmer, who had been with Microsoft since 1980. He positioned himself as chief software architect so he could concentrate on what was for him the more passionate side of the business, though he remained chairman of the board.\u00a0 Over the next few years, Bill\u2019s involvement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation occupied much of his time and even more of his interest. In 2006, Gates announced he was transitioning himself from full-time work at Microsoft to devote more quality time to the foundation. His last full day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. In February 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in order to move into a new position as technology adviser; longtime Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was replaced by 46-year-old Satya Nadella. Gates continues to devote much of his time and energy to the work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The organization tackles international and domestic issues, such as health and education and helping students in the United States become college-ready. In 2015, Gates spoke out in favor of national Common Core standards in grades K through 12 and charter schools. Gates also proved to be a groundbreaking employer when, around this time, the foundation announced that it would give its employees a year&apos;s paid leave after the birth or the adoption of a child.\u00a0 Bill Gates was born William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington.\u00a0 Bill Gates grew up in an upper middle-class family with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their father, William H. Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law student when he met his future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an athletic, outgoing student at the University of Washington, actively involved in student affairs and leadership. The Gates family atmosphere was warm and close, and all three children were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence. Bill showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family athletic games at their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished in playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled at Monopoly.\u00a0 Bill had a very close relationship with his mother, Mary, who after a brief career as a teacher devoted her time to helping raise the children and working on civic affairs and with charities. She also served on several corporate boards, including those of the First Interstate Bank in Seattle (founded by her grandfather), the United Way and International Business Machines (IBM). She would often take Bill along when she volunteered in schools and at community organizations. Bill was a voracious reader as a child, spending many hours poring over reference books such as the encyclopedia. Around the age of 11 or 12, Bill&apos;s parents began to have concerns about his behavior. He was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times, and his parents worried he might become a loner. Though they were strong believers in public education, when Bill turned 13, they enrolled him at Seattle&apos;s exclusive preparatory Lakeside School. He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, excelling in math and science, but also doing very well in drama and English. While at Lakeside School, a Seattle computer company offered to provide computer time for the students. The Mother&apos;s Club used proceeds from the school&apos;s rummage sale to purchase a teletype terminal for students to use. Bill Gates became entranced with what a computer could do and spent much of his free time working on the terminal. He wrote a tic-tac-toe program in BASIC computer language that allowed users to play against the computer. Gates graduated from Lakeside in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the college SAT test, a feat of intellectual achievement that for several years he boasted about when introducing himself to new people. Gates enrolled at Harvard University in the fall of 1973, originally thinking of a career in law. But his freshman year saw him spend more of his time in the computer lab than in class. Gates did not really have a study regimen. Instead, he could get by on a few hours of sleep, cram for a test, and pass with a reasonable grade. Much to his parents&apos; dismay, within two years Gates dropped out of college in 1975 to pursue his business, Microsoft, with partner Paul Allen. At Lakeside School Gates met Paul Allen, who was two years his senior. The pair became fast friends, bonding over their common enthusiasm for computers, even though they were very different people. Allen was more reserved and shy. Bill was feisty and at times combative. Regardless of their differences, they both spent much of their free time together working on programs. Occasionally, the two disagreed and would clash over who was right or who should run the computer lab. On one occasion, their argument escalated to the point where Allen banned Gates from the computer lab.\u00a0 At one point, Gates and Allen had their school computer privileges revoked for taking advantage of software glitches to obtain free computer time from the company that provided the computers. After their probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to debug the program. During this time, Gates developed a payroll program for the computer company the boys hacked into and a scheduling program for the school. In 1970, at the age of 15, Bill Gates and Paul Allen went into business together, developing \"Traf-o-Data,\" a computer program that monitored traffic patterns in Seattle. They netted $20,000 for their efforts. Gates and Allen wanted to start their own company, but Gates&apos; parents wanted him to finish school and go on to college, where they hoped he would work to become a lawyer. Allen went to Washington State University, while Gates went to Harvard, though the pair stayed in touch. After attending college for two years, Allen dropped out and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to work for Honeywell. Around this time, he showed Gates an edition of Popular Electronics magazine featuring an article on the Altair 8800 mini-computer kit. Both boys were fascinated with the possibilities of what this computer could create in the world of personal computing.\u00a0 The Altair was made by a small company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). Gates and Allen contacted the company, proclaiming that they were working on a BASIC software program that would run the Altair computer. In reality, they didn&apos;t have an Altair to work with or the code to run it, but they wanted to know if MITS was interested in someone developing such software.\u00a0 MITS was, and its president, Ed Roberts, asked the boys for a demonstration. Gates and Allen scrambled, spending the next two months writing the software at Harvard&apos;s computer lab. Allen traveled to Albuquerque for a test run at MITS, never having tried it out on an Altair computer. It worked perfectly. Allen was hired at MITS, and Gates soon left Harvard to work with him. Together they founded Microsoft.\u00a0 Paul Allen remained with Microsoft until 1983, when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin&apos;s disease. Though his cancer went into remission a year later with intensive treatment, Allen resigned from the company. Rumors abound as to why Allen left Microsoft. Some say Bill Gates pushed him out, but many say it was a life-changing experience for Allen and he saw there were other opportunities that he could invest his time in. In 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen formed Micro-Soft, a blend of \"micro-computer\" and \"software\" (they dropped the hyphen to Microsoft within a year). Although the company started out on shaky footing, by 1979 Microsoft was grossing approximately $2.5 million, and, at the age of 23, Gates placed himself as the head of the company. With his acumen for software development and a keen business sense, he led the company and worked as its spokesperson. Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, often rewriting code himself when he saw it necessary.\u00a0 Following the development of software for IBM, between 1979 and 1981 Microsoft&apos;s growth exploded. Staff increased from 25 to 128, and revenue shot up from $2.5 million to $16 million. In mid-1981, Gates and Allen incorporated Microsoft, and Gates was appointed president and chairman of the board. Allen was named executive vice president. At first, all was not smooth sailing. Although Microsoft\u2019s BASIC software program for the Altair computer netted the company a fee and royalties, it wasn&apos;t meeting their overhead. According to Gates&apos; later account, only about 10 percent of the people using BASIC in the Altair computer had actually paid for it. Microsoft&apos;s BASIC software was popular with computer hobbyists, who obtained pre-market copies and were reproducing and distributing them for free. At this time, much of the personal computer enthusiasts were people not in it for the money. They felt the ease of reproduction and distribution allowed them to share software with friends and fellow computer enthusiasts. Bill Gates thought differently. He saw the free distribution of software as stealing, especially when it involved software that was created to be sold. In February 1976, Gates wrote an open letter to computer hobbyists, saying that continued distribution and use of software without paying for it would \"prevent good software from being written.\" In essence, pirating software would discourage developers from investing time and money into creating quality software. The letter was unpopular with computer enthusiasts, but Gates stuck to his beliefs and would use the threat of innovation as a defense when faced with charges of unfair business practices. Gates had an acrimonious relationship with MITS president Ed Roberts, often resulting in shouting matches. The combative Gates clashed with Roberts on software development and the direction of the business. Roberts considered Gates spoiled and obnoxious. In 1977, Roberts sold MITS to another computer company and went back to Georgia to enter medical school and become a doctor.\u00a0 Gates and Allen were on their own. The pair had to sue the new owner of MITS to retain the software rights they had developed for Altair. Microsoft wrote software in different formats for other computer companies, and, at the beginning of 1979, Gates moved the company&apos;s operations to Bellevue, Washington, just east of Seattle. Gates was glad to be home again in the Pacific Northwest, and threw himself into his work. All 25 employees of the young company had broad responsibilities for all aspects of the operation, product development, business development and marketing.\u00a0 As the computer industry began to grow, with companies like Apple, Intel and IBM developing hardware and components, Bill was continuously out on the road touting the merits of Microsoft software applications. He often took his mother with him. Mary was highly respected and well connected with her membership on several corporate boards, including IBM&apos;s. It was through Mary that Bill Gates met the CEO of IBM. In November 1980, IBM was looking for software that would operate their upcoming personal computer (PC) and approached Microsoft. Legend has it that at the first meeting with Bill Gates someone at IBM mistook him for an office assistant and asked him to serve coffee.\u00a0 Gates did look very young, but he quickly impressed IBM, convincing them that he and his company could meet their needs. The only problem was that Microsoft had not developed the basic operating system that would run IBM&apos;s new computers. Not to be stopped, Gates bought an operating system that was developed to run on computers similar to IBM&apos;s PC. He made a deal with the software&apos;s developer, making Microsoft the exclusive licensing agent and later full owner of the software but not telling them of the IBM deal. The company later sued Microsoft and Gates for withholding important information. Microsoft settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, but neither Gates nor Microsoft admitted to any wrongdoing. Gates had to adapt the newly purchased software to work for the IBM PC. He delivered it for a $50,000 fee, the same price he had paid for the software in its original form. IBM wanted to buy the source code, which would have given them the information to the operating system. Gates refused, instead proposing that IBM pay a licensing fee for copies of the software sold with their computers. Doing this allowed Microsoft to license the software they called MS-DOS to any other PC manufacturer, should other computer companies clone the IBM PC, which they soon did. Microsoft also released software called Softcard, which allowed Microsoft BASIC to operate on Apple II machines. By 1983, Microsoft was going global with offices in Great Britain and Japan, and with 30 percent of the world&apos;s computers running on its software.\u00a0 Though their rivalry is legend, Microsoft and Apple shared many of their early innovations. In 1981, Apple, at the time led by Steve Jobs, invited Microsoft to help develop software for Macintosh computers. Some developers were involved in both Microsoft development and the development of Microsoft applications for Macintosh. The collaboration could be seen in some shared names between the Microsoft and Macintosh systems.\u00a0 It was through this knowledge sharing that Microsoft was to develop Windows, a system that used a mouse to drive a graphic interface, displaying text and images on the screen. This differed greatly from the text-and-keyboard driven MS-DOS system where all text formatting showed on the screen as code and not what actually would be printed. Bill Gates quickly recognized the threat this kind of software might pose for MS-DOS and Microsoft overall. For the unsophisticated user\u2014which was most of the buying public\u2014the graphic imagery of the competing VisiCorp software used in a Macintosh system would be so much easier to use.\u00a0 Gates announced in an advertising campaign that a new Microsoft operating system was about to be developed that would use a graphic interface. It was to be called \"Windows,\" and would be compatible with all PC software products developed on the MS-DOS system. The announcement was a bluff, in that Microsoft had no such program under development. But as a marketing tactic it was sheer genius, as nearly 30 percent of the computer market was using the MS-DOS system and would wait for Windows software rather than change to a new system. Without people willing to change formats, software developers were unwilling to write programs for the VisiCorp system and it lost momentum by early 1985. In November 1985, nearly two years after his announcement, Bill Gates and Microsoft launched Windows. Visually the Windows system looked very similar to the Macintosh system Apple Computer Corporation had introduced nearly two years earlier. Apple had earlier given Microsoft full access to their technology while it was working on making Microsoft products compatible for Apple computers. Gates had advised Apple to license their software but they ignored the advice, being more interested in selling computers.\u00a0 Once again, Gates took full advantage of the situation and created a software format that was strikingly similar to the Macintosh. Apple threatened to sue, and Microsoft retaliated, saying it would delay shipment of its Microsoft-compatible software for Macintosh users. In the end, Microsoft prevailed in the courts because it could prove that while there were similarities in how the two software systems operated, each individual function was distinctly different. Bill Gates&apos; intelligence allowed him to be able to see all sides of the software industry\u2014product development and corporate strategy. When analyzing any corporate move, he would develop a profile of all the possible cases and run through them, asking questions about anything that could possibly happen.\u00a0 Despite the success of Microsoft, Bill Gates never felt totally secure. Always looking over his shoulder to check on the competition, Gates developed a white-hot drive and competitive spirit. Gates expected everyone in the company to have the same dedication. Gates&apos; assistant reported coming to work early to find someone sleeping under a desk. She considered calling security or the police, until she discovered it was Gates. His confrontational management style also became legend, as he would challenge employees and their ideas to keep the creative process going. An unprepared presenter could hear, \"That&apos;s the stupidest thing I&apos;ve ever heard!\" from Gates. But this was as much a test of the rigor of the employee as it was Gates&apos; passion for his company. He was constantly checking the people around him to see if they were really convinced of their ideas. Outside the company, Bill Gates was gaining a reputation as a ruthless competitor. Several tech companies, led by IBM, began to develop their own operating system, called OS/2, to replace MS-DOS. Rather than give in to the pressure, Gates pushed ahead with the Windows software, improving its operation and expanding its uses. In 1989, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Office, which bundled office productivity applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel into one system that was compatible with all Microsoft products. The applications were not as easily compatible with OS/2. Microsoft&apos;s new version of Windows sold 100,000 copies in just two weeks, and OS/2 soon faded away. This left Microsoft with a virtual monopoly on operating systems for PCs. Soon the Federal Trade Commission began to investigate Microsoft for unfair marketing practices. Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft faced a string of Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department investigations. Some related allegations that Microsoft made unfair deals with computer manufacturers who installed the Windows operating system on their computers. Other charges involved Microsoft forcing computer manufactures to sell Microsoft&apos;s Internet Explorer as a condition for selling the Windows operating system with their computers. At one point, Microsoft faced a possible break up of its two divisions\u2014operating systems and software development. Microsoft defended itself, harking back to Bill Gates&apos; earlier battles with software piracy and proclaiming that such restrictions were a threat to innovation. Eventually, Microsoft was able to find a settlement with the federal government to avoid a breakup.\u00a0 Through it all, Gates found some inventive ways to deflect the pressure with lighthearted commercials and public appearances at computer trade shows during which he posed as Star Trek&apos;s Mr. Spock. Gates continued to run the company and weather the federal investigations through the 1990s. In addition to being one of the richest and most successful businessmen in the history of the world, Bill Gates has also received numerous awards for philanthropic work. Time magazine named Gates one of the most influential people of the 20th century. The magazine also named Gates and his wife Melinda, along with rock band U2&apos;s lead singer, Bono, as the 2005 Persons of the Year. Gates holds several honorary doctorates from universities throughout the world. He was knighted as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.\u00a0 In 2006, Gates and his wife were awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle by the Mexican government for their philanthropic work throughout the world in the areas of health and education. In 2016, Gates and his wife Melinda were recognized for their philanthropic work when they were named recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.

He remains the world's richest person, despite giving away 64 million shares in Microsoft. The shares are equivalent to 5% of his total fortune, currently estimated to be $89.9bn. Since 1994 Mr Gates, 61, and his wife Melinda have given away a total of $35bn in cash and stocks to a range of charitable causes. The donation was made in June but became public on Monday following the filing of a document with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Gates' share in Microsoft is now just 1.3%. Prior to this, Mr Gates gave away $16bn in Microsoft shares in 1999 and $5.1bn in 2000.  The majority of all previous donations have been made to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is primarily focused on reducing world poverty, combating infectious diseases and providing universal access to computers. It is not known who the recipient of this latest donation is, however when federal documents are filed, it usually means new money is being given to a foundation, the Chronicle of Philanthropy reports.   In 2010, Mr and Mrs Gates and the well-known investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett created the Giving Pledge, and as of May 2017, 158 individuals or couples have agreed to contribute at least half of their wealth to charity.  This latest donation is the biggest charitable gift to have been made anywhere in the world so far this year. The second largest was made by Mr Buffett, who donated almost $3.2bn to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation last month. And the third biggest came from Dell Computer Corporation founder Michael Dell and his wife Susan.  In May the couple gave more than $1bn to their foundation, which focuses on children's issues and community initiatives.

In 1986, when the company went public, Gates held 45% (pdf) of its shares; in 1996, his stake had nearly halved to 24%; and now, with his latest 64-million-share donation, he\u2019s down to a mere 1.3%, according to Bloomberg. (On the other hand, his 45% in 1986 was worth $350 million, and his 1.3% today is worth around $7.3 billion.) The trend is in large part due to Bill and Melinda Gates\u2019 philanthropic activities. In 2010, they established the Giving Pledge along with fellow billionaire Warren Buffett to commit the majority of their wealth to charity. And since 1994, Bloomberg reports, the couple has gifted roughly $35 billion in stocks and cash. But Gates hasn\u2019t only been donating shares to charity. SEC filings show that between his gift-giving, Gates has been gradually selling off shares for at least the last four years (as far back as SEC\u2019s full-text search database goes). Before giving a large gift of 31 million shares in November of 2014, he was selling roughly 100 million shares per year. After that gift, the annual rate dropped to around 57 million. At this rate, with a little over 100 million shares left to his name, according to his last SEC filing, the tech mogul will have no more stock in his company by the middle of 2019.",

While the recipient of the gift wasn\u2019t specified, Mr Gates has made the majority of his donations to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the charity he and his wife use to direct their philanthropic efforts. It\u2019s the largest gift of Microsoft shares that Mr\u00a0Gates has made since 2000. The 61-year-old gave away $16 billion worth of Microsoft shares in 1999 and $5.1bn a year later, according to calculations by Bloomberg.

Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality. Trump was born in the New York City borough of Queens. He earned an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. A third-generation businessman, Trump followed in the footsteps of his grandmother Elizabeth and father Fred in running the family real estate company. He served as chairman and president of The Trump Organization from 1971 until his inauguration as president in January 2017, when he delegated company management to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric. Trump's business career primarily focused on building or renovating office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump also started several side ventures and branded various products with his name. He has written or co-authored several books (including The Art of the Deal), and he produced and hosted The Apprentice television series for 12 years. As of 2017[update], he was the 544th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $3.5\u00a0billion. Trump had long expressed interest in politics. He entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. His campaign received extensive free media coverage; many of his public statements were controversial or false. Trump won the general election on November 8, 2016, in a surprise victory against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election despite losing the popular vote. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. In domestic policy, Trump has sought, so far without success, to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He appointed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; the ban was partially implemented after legal challenges. In foreign policy, he withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Agreement, undid parts of the Cuban Thaw, and asked Muslim leaders to drive out extremists from their countries at the 2017 Riyadh summit. After Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, the Justice Department appointed a special counsel to continue the investigation into potential links between Russia and Trump campaign associates, and any related matters. Trump's ancestors originated from the German village of Kallstadt, Palatinate, on his father's side, and from the Outer Hebrides isles of Scotland on his mother's side. All his grandparents, and his mother, were born in Europe. His mother's grandfather was also christened \"Donald\".[2] Trump's paternal grandfather, Friedrich Trump, first emigrated to the United States in 1885 at the age of 16, and became a citizen in 1892. He amassed a fortune operating boom-town restaurants and boarding houses in the Seattle area and the Klondike region of Canada during the gold rush.[3] On a visit to Kallstadt, he met Elisabeth Christ and married her in 1902. The couple settled in New York permanently in 1905.[4] Frederick died from influenza during the 1918 pandemic.[5] Donald's father, Fred Trump, was born in 1905 in the Bronx. Fred started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15, shortly after his father's death. Their company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, was primarily active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. Fred eventually built and sold thousands of houses, barracks and apartments.[5][6] The company would later become The Trump Organization after Donald Trump took over in 1971.[7] Donald's mother, Mary Anne, was born in Tong, Lewis, Scotland. At age 18 in 1930, she emigrated to New York, where she worked as a maid.[8] Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens.[8][9] Donald's uncle John Trump was an electrical engineer, physicist, and inventor. He was also a professor at MIT from 1936 to 1973. During World War II, he was involved in radar research for the Allies and helped design X-ray machines that were used to treat cancer.[10] Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Queens, New York City. He was the fourth of five children born to Frederick Trump (1905\u20131999) and Mary Anne Trump (n\u00e9e MacLeod, 1912\u20132000).[13] His siblings are Maryanne (b. 1937), Fred Jr. (1938\u20131981), Elizabeth (b. 1942), and Robert (b. 1948). Trump grew up in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens. He attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade. At age 13, he enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, after his parents discovered that he had made frequent trips into Manhattan without their permission.[14][15] In August 1964, Trump began his higher education at Fordham University.[11][16] After two years, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, because it offered one of the few real-estate studies departments in United States academia at the time.[16][17] In addition to his father, Trump was inspired by Manhattan developer William Zeckendorf, vowing to be \"even bigger and better\".[18] While at Wharton, he worked at the family business, Elizabeth Trump and Son,[19] graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.[16][20][21] Trump was not drafted during the Vietnam War, and he did not enlist either as a volunteer or as a Reserve Officer Training Corps candidate.[22] While Trump was in college from 1964 to 1968, he obtained four student deferments.[23] In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a military medical examination, and in 1968 was briefly classified as fit by a local draft board. In September of that year, he was given a medical deferment, which he later attributed to heel spurs.[24] In 1969, he received a high number in the draft lottery, which gave him a low probability to be called to military service.[24][25][26] Trump has five children by three marriages, as well as nine grandchildren.[27][28] His first two marriages ended in widely publicized divorces.[29] Trump was 30 years old when he married his first wife, Czech model Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1, on April 7, 1977, at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan in a ceremony performed by the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale.[30][31] They had three children: son Donald Jr. (b. 1977), daughter Ivanka (b. 1981), and son Eric (b. 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[32] The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.[33] In October 1993, Maples gave birth to Trump's daughter, who was named Tiffany after high-end retailer Tiffany & Company.[34] Maples and Trump were married two months later on December 20, 1993.[35] They divorced in 1999,[36] and Tiffany was raised by Marla in California.[37] On January 22, 2005, Trump married his third wife, Slovenian model Melania Knauss, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida. The ceremony was followed by a reception at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.[38] In 2006, Melania acquired United States citizenship[39] and on March 20 of that year, she gave birth to a son whom they named Barron.[40][41] Melania became First Lady of the United States upon Trump's inauguration as the nation's 45th president in January 2017.[42] Upon his inauguration as president, Trump delegated the management of his real estate business to his two adult sons, Eric and Don Jr.[43] His daughter Ivanka resigned from The Trump Organization and moved to Washington with her husband Jared Kushner. She serves as an assistant to the president,[44] and he is a Senior Advisor in the White House.[45] Trump's elder sister, Maryanne Barry, is an inactive Federal Appeals Court judge on the Third Circuit.[46] Trump's ancestors were Lutheran on his father's side in Germany[47] and Presbyterian on his mother's side in Scotland.[48] His parents married in a Manhattan Presbyterian church in 1936.[49] As a child, he attended the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, and had his Confirmation there.[31] In the 1970s, his family joined the Marble Collegiate Church (an affiliate of the Reformed Church in America) in Manhattan.[50] The pastor at that church, Norman Vincent Peale, author of The Power of Positive Thinking and The Art of Living, ministered to Trump's family and mentored him until Peale's death in 1993.[51][50] Trump, who is Presbyterian,[52][53] has cited Peale and his works during interviews when asked about the role of religion in his personal life.[50] Trump receives Holy Communion, but he has said that he does not ask God for forgiveness. He stated: \"I think if I do something wrong, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture.\"[54] On the campaign trail, Trump has referred to The Art of the Deal as his second favorite book after the Bible, saying, \"Nothing beats the Bible.\"[55] In a 2016 speech to Liberty University, he referred to \"2 Corinthians\" (pronounced \"Second Corinthians\") as \"Two Corinthians\", eliciting chuckles from the audience.[56][57] The New York Times reported that Evangelical Christians nationwide thought \"that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure\".[58] Trump has had associations with a number of Christian spiritual leaders, including Florida pastor Paula White, who has been called his \"closest spiritual confidant.\"[59] In 2015, he received a blessing from Greek Orthodox priest Emmanuel Lemelson[60] and in 2016, he released a list of his religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed and others.[61] Referring to his daughter Ivanka's conversion to Judaism before her marriage to Jared Kushner, Trump said: \"I have a Jewish daughter; and I am very honored by that.\"[62] Trump's physician, Harold Bornstein, issued a 2016 medical report that showed Trump's blood pressure and liver and thyroid function to be in normal ranges.[63][64] He is overweight and takes statins to lower his cholesterol.[64] Trump has said that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed drugs, including marijuana.[65] He also drinks no alcohol; this decision arose in part from watching his older brother Fred Jr. suffer from alcoholism that contributed to his early death in 1981.[66][67] Trump said that he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father.[68] He appeared on the initial Forbes 400 list of wealthy individuals in 1982 with an estimated $200\u00a0million fortune, including an \"undefined\" share of his parents' estate.[69] During the late 1980s he became a billionaire,[70], and made the Forbes World's Billionaires list for the first time in 1989,[71] but he was absent from the Forbes 400 list following business losses from 1990 to 1995; he reportedly borrowed from his siblings' trusts in 1993.[69] His father's estate, valued at more than $20\u00a0million, was divided in 1999 among Trump, his three surviving siblings and their children.[72][73] When Trump announced his candidacy for the presidency on June 16, 2015, he released a one-page financial summary that stated a net worth of $8,737,540,000.[75] The following month, he filed a 92-page FEC financial disclosure form[76] and declared his net worth was \"in excess of ten billion dollars\".[77] In his presidential announcement speech, he said \"I'm really rich\", and stated this would make him less indebted to large campaign donors.[78][79] Forbes believed his net worth estimate was \"a whopper\", setting their own estimate at $4.1\u00a0billion in 2015. Trump valued his \"properties under development\" at $293 million; Forbes said they could not evaluate those deals, and booked them for $0.[80][81] Trump's 2015 FEC disclosure reported $362\u00a0million in total income for the year 2014.[77] After Trump made controversial remarks about illegal immigrants in 2015, he lost business contracts with several companies; this reduced his Forbes estimate by $125\u00a0million.[82] Consumer boycotts and reduced bookings may have further affected his brand value during the presidential campaign.[83][84][85] Trump's 104-page FEC disclosure in May 2016[86] still claimed a total wealth over $10\u00a0billion, unchanged from 2015.[76] The release of the Access Hollywood tapes in October 2016 put further pressure on his brand,[87] but real estate experts predicted a positive rebound after he was elected.[88] In its 2017 billionaires' ranking, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $3.5\u00a0billion (544th in the world, 201st in the U.S.)[1] making him one of the richest politicians in American history. These estimates fluctuate from year to year, and among various analysts. In July 2016 Bloomberg News had pegged his wealth at $3\u00a0billion, calling it an increase thanks to his presidential nomination,[89] whereas Forbes had ranked him 324th in the world (113th in the U.S.) with $4.5\u00a0billion just a few months earlier.[90] The discrepancies among these estimates and with Trump's own figures stem from the uncertain values of appraised property and of his personal brand.[89][91] Trump started his career at his father's real estate development company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, which focused on middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs, but also had business elsewhere.[92] For example, during his undergraduate study, Trump joined his father Fred in successfully revitalizing the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, thereby boosting the occupancy rate from 66% to 100%.[93][94] When his father became chairman of the board in 1971, Trump was promoted to president of the company and renamed it The Trump Organization.[7][95] In 1973, he and his father drew wider attention when the Justice Department contended that the organization systematically discriminated against African Americans wishing to rent apartments rather than merely screening out people based on low income as the Trumps stated. Under an agreement reached in 1975, the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing, and made the Urban League an intermediary for qualified minority applicants.[96][97] His adviser and attorney during (and after) that period was Roy Cohn, who responded to attacks by counterattacking with maximum force, and who valued both positive and negative publicity, which were attitudes that Trump appreciated.[98] In 1978, Trump consummated his first major real estate deal in Manhattan when he purchased a half-share in the decrepit Commodore Hotel. The purchase was largely funded by a $70\u00a0million construction loan that was jointly guaranteed by Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain. Designed by architect Der Scutt, the project was able to proceed by leveraging competing interests and by taking advantage of tax breaks.[99] After remodeling, the hotel reopened as the Grand Hyatt Hotel, located next to Grand Central Terminal.[100][101] Also in 1978, Trump finished negotiations to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 202-meter (663-foot) skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, which The New York Times attributed to his \"persistence\" and \"skills as a negotiator\".[102] To make way for the new building, a crew of undocumented Polish workers demolished an old Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features that had initially been marked for preservation.[103] The building was completed in 1983 and houses both the primary penthouse condominium residence of Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization.[104][105] Architectural critic Paul Goldberger said in 1983 that he was surprised to find the tower's atrium was \"the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years\".[106][107] Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television show The Apprentice and includes a fully functional television studio set.[108] Repairs on Central Park's Wollman Rink were started in 1980 by a general contractor who was unconnected to Trump. Despite an expected two and one-half\u00a0year construction schedule, the repairs were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $1.95\u00a0million, $775,000 less than the initial budget, and operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity in exchange for the rink's concession rights.[109] In 1988 Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for a record-setting $407\u00a0million and asked his wife Ivana to manage its operation.[110] Trump invested $50\u00a0million to restore the building, which he called \"the Mona Lisa\".[111] According to hotel expert Thomas McConnell, the Trumps boosted it from a three-star to a four-star ranking and sold it in 1995, by which time Ivana was no longer involved.[112] In 1994, Trump became involved with a building on Columbus Circle that was swaying in the wind. He began a reconstruction project that stopped the swaying and gave the building a full makeover.[113][114] Trump thereafter owned commercial space in that 44-story mixed-use tower (hotel and condominium), which he named Trump International Hotel and Tower.[115] In 1996, Trump acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street that had briefly been the tallest building in the world when it was completed in 1930. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street.[116] In 1997, he began construction on Riverside South, which he dubbed Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. The project encountered delays the following year because a subcontracter had to replace defective concrete.[117][118] He and the other investors in the project ultimately sold their interest for $1.8 billion in 2005 in what was then the biggest residential sale in the history of New York City.[119] From 1994 to 2002, Trump owned a 50% share of the Empire State Building. He would have renamed it \"Trump Empire State Building Tower Apartments\" if he had been able to boost his share.[120][121] In 2001, Trump completed Trump World Tower, which was across from the headquarters of the United Nations. For a while, the structure was the tallest all-residential tower in the world.[122] In 2002, Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue; the building consisted of 35 stories of luxury condominiums.[123] Meanwhile, he continued to own millions of square feet of other prime Manhattan real estate.[124] In 1985, Trump acquired the historic Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida for $5\u00a0million plus $3\u00a0million for the home's furnishings. The home was built in the 1920s by heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post, who envisioned the house as a future winter retreat for American presidents. Trump's initial offer of $28\u00a0million had been rejected, and he was able to get the property at the much lower price by purchasing separate beachfront property and threatening to build a house on it that would block Mar-a-Lago's ocean view. In addition to using the estate as a home, Trump also turned it into a private club open to everyone who could afford the initiation fee of $100,000 plus annual dues.[125] In 1986, Trump acquired a foreclosed 33-story, twin-tower condominium complex in nearby West Palm Beach for $40\u00a0million. Auto CEO Lee Iacocca invested in three of the condos.[126] Trump spruced up the complex's public areas and heavily promoted the property for years, but selling the units proved difficult, and the deal turned out to be unprofitable.[127] New Jersey legalized casino gambling in 1977, and the following year Trump was in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to explore how he might get involved in a new business venture. Seven years later, Harrah's at Trump Plaza hotel and casino opened there; the multi-use unit was built by Trump with financing from Holiday Corporation, which also was managing that business.[128] Renamed \"Trump Plaza\" soon after opening, it was at that time the tallest building in Atlantic City.[129] The casino's poor financial results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp., which led to Trump's paying $70\u00a0million in May 1986 to buy out their interest in the property.[130][131] Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320\u00a0million; when completed in 1985, that hotel and casino became Trump Castle, and Trump's wife, Ivana, managed that property until Trump transferred her in 1988 to run the Trump Plaza Hotel in New York.[132][133] Also in 1988, Trump acquired his third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal (then halfway through construction), by making a complex transaction with the television host and entertainer Merv Griffin as well as the resort and casino company Resorts International.[134] In October 1989, three of his top Atlantic City executives were killed in a helicopter accident, which both stymied and delayed the planned opening of the Taj Mahal.[135] The Taj finally opened in April 1990 and was built at a total cost of $1.1\u00a0billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever.[136][137] The project was financed with $675\u00a0million in junk bonds[138] and was a major gamble by Trump.[139] The project underwent debt restructuring the following year,[140] leaving Trump with 50% ownership.[141] He also sold his 282-foot (86\u00a0m) megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers.[142][143] In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana.[144] THCR purchased Taj Mahal in 1996 and underwent bankruptcy restructuring in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[145] From mid 1995 until early 2009, he served as chairman of the publicly-traded THCR organization\u2014which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts\u2014and served as CEO from mid 2000 to mid 2005.[146] During the 1990s, Trump's casino ventures faced competition from Native American gaming at the Foxwoods casino located on an Indian reservation in Connecticut, where it was exempt from the state's anti-gambling laws. Trump stated in 1993 that the casino owners did not look like real Indians to him or to other Indians.[147] Subsequent to that well-publicized remark about the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, Trump became a key investor backing the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots, who were also seeking state recognition.[148] The Trump Organization operates many golf courses and resorts in the United States and around the world. According to Golfweek, Trump owns or manages about 18 golf courses.[149] His personal financial disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission stated that his golf and resort revenue for the year 2015 was roughly $382\u00a0million,[76][86] while his three European golf courses did not show a profit.[89] In 2006, Trump bought 1,400\u00a0acres (570\u00a0ha), including the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and created a golf resort there.[150] Scottish supporters emphasized potential economic benefits, and opponents emphasized potential environmental harm to a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).[151][152][153] A spokesperson for the golf course has said 95% of the SSSI is untouched.[154] A 2011 independent documentary, You've Been Trumped, chronicled the golf resort's construction and struggles.[155] In 2015, an offshore windfarm being built within sight of the golf course prompted a legal challenge by Trump, which was dismissed by the U.K. Supreme Court.[156] In the wake of the 2008 recession, Trump greatly scaled back development of this property, and as of December 2016 Scottish officials were pushing for completion of the far larger development as originally approved.[157] In April 2014, Trump purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland, which hosted the Open Championship four times between 1977 and 2009.[158][159] After extensive renovations and a remodeling of the course by golf architect Martin Ebert, Turnberry was re-opened in June 2016.[160] In the late 2000s and early 2010s, The Trump Organization expanded its footprint in the United States beyond New York and into a few other countries with the co-development and management of hotel towers in Chicago, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., Panama City, Toronto, and Vancouver. There are also Trump-branded buildings in Dubai, Honolulu, Istanbul, Manila, Mumbai and in Indonesia.[161] Trump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies. He has also licensed his name for various commercial products and services. In doing so, he achieved mixed success for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects.[162] In 2011, Forbes' financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200\u00a0million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3\u00a0billion.[163] As of 2016, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 3,500 state and federal legal actions. He or one of his companies was the plaintiff in 1,900 cases and the defendant in 1,450. With Trump or his company as plaintiff, more than half the cases have been against gamblers at his casinos who had failed to pay off their debts. With Trump or his company as a defendant, the most common type of case involved personal injury cases at his hotels. In cases where there was a clear resolution, Trump's side won 451 times and lost 38.[164][165] Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, but his hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[166][167] Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, \"I do play with the bankruptcy laws\u00a0\u2013 they're very good for me\" as a tool for trimming debt.[168][169] The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[170][171] Trump said, \"I've used the laws of this country to pare debt\u00a0... We'll have the company. We'll throw it into a chapter. We'll negotiate with the banks. We'll make a fantastic deal. You know, it's like on The Apprentice. It's not personal. It's just business.\"[140] A 2016 analysis of Trump's business career by The Economist concluded that his \"...\u00a0performance [from 1985 to 2016] has been mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York\", noting both his successes and bankruptcies.[172] A subsequent analysis by The Washington Post concluded that \"Trump is a mix of braggadocio, business failures, and real success\", calling his casino bankruptcies the \"most infamous flop\" of his business career.[173] After Trump took charge of the family real estate firm in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization, he not only greatly expanded its real estate operations, but also ventured into numerous other business activities. The company eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.[174] In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals\u2014an American football team that played in the United States Football League (USFL)\u2014from oil magnate J.\u00a0Walter Duncan. The USFL played three seasons during the spring and summer. After the 1985 season, the organization folded due to continuous financial difficulties, despite winning an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL.[175] Trump remained involved with other sports after the Generals folded; he operated golf courses in several countries.[175] At the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, he hosted several boxing matches, which included Mike Tyson's 1988 heavyweight championship fight against Michael Spinks.[176] He also acted as a financial advisor to Mike Tyson.[177] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[178] From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe pageants.[179][180] The Miss Universe Pageants include Miss USA and Miss Teen USA, and his management of this business involved his family members; for example, daughter Ivanka once hosted Miss Teen USA. Trump hired the first female president of the Miss Universe business in 1997.[181] He became dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled the pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002.[182][183] In his 2015 U.S. presidential campaign kickoff speech, Trump made statements about illegal immigrants who crossed the border from Mexico. NBC then decided to end its business relationship with him and stated that it would no longer air the Miss Universe or Miss USA pageants on its networks.[184] In September 2015, Trump bought NBC's share of the Miss Universe Organization and became its sole owner for three days. He then sold the entire company to the WME/IMG talent agency.[185] Trump University was a for-profit education company that was founded by Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny. The company ran a real estate training program and charged between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[186][187][188] In 2005, the operation was notified by New York State authorities that its use of the word \"university\" was misleading and violated state law. After a second such notification in 2010, the name of the company was changed to the \"Trump Entrepreneurial Institute\".[189] Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[190] In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40\u00a0million civil suit alleging that Trump University made false statements and defrauded consumers.[189][191] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court relating to Trump University; they named Trump personally as well as his companies.[192] During the presidential campaign, Trump criticized Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel who oversaw those two cases, alleging bias in his rulings because of his Mexican heritage.[193][194] Shortly after Trump won the presidency, the parties agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases, whereby Trump paid a total of $25\u00a0million and denied any wrongdoing.[195][196] The Donald J. Trump Foundation is a U.S.-based private foundation[197] established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal.[198][199] The foundation's funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump,[200] who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.[200] The foundation's tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[201] In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York\u2013Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000).[202][203] From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5\u00a0million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007.[200] Linda McMahon later became Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[204] In 2016, investigations by The Washington Post uncovered several potential legal and ethical violations conducted by the charity, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[205] After beginning an investigation into the foundation, the New York State Attorney General's office notified the Trump Foundation that it was allegedly in violation of New York laws regarding charities, and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[206][207][208] A Trump spokesman called the investigation a \"partisan hit job\".[206] In response to mounting complaints, Trump's team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove \"even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President.\"[209] When Trump was elected president of the United States in November 2016, questions arose over how he would avoid conflicts of interest between his work in the White House and his business activities. At a press conference on January 10, 2017, Trump said that he and his daughter Ivanka would resign all roles with The Trump Organization, while his two adult sons Don Jr. and Eric would run the business, together with Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg.[210] Trump retained his financial stake in the business.[211] His attorney Sherri Dillon said that before the January 20 inauguration, Trump would put those business assets into a trust, which would hire an ethics advisor and a compliance counsel. She added that The Trump Organization would not enter any new foreign business deals, while continuing to pursue domestic opportunities.[212] As of April 2017, Trump companies owned more than 400 condo units and home lots in the United States, valued at over $250\u00a0million in total ($200,000 to $35\u00a0million each).[213] In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show The Apprentice, in which a group of competitors battled for a high-level management job in one of Trump's commercial enterprises. Contestants were successively \"fired\" and eliminated from the game. For the first year of the show, Trump earned $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show's initial success, he was paid $1\u00a0million per episode.[214] In a July 2015 press release, Trump's campaign manager said that NBCUniversal had paid him $213,606,575 for his 14 seasons hosting the show,[77] although the network did not verify the statement.[215] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to television on The Apprentice.[162][216] Along with British TV producer Mark Burnett, Trump was hired as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities compete to win money for their charities. While Trump and Burnett co-produced the show, Trump stayed in the forefront, deciding winners and \"firing\" losers. International versions of The Apprentice franchise were co-produced by Burnett and Trump. On February 16, 2015, NBC announced that they would be renewing The Apprentice for a 15th season.[217] On February 27, Trump stated that he was \"not ready\" to sign on for another season because of the possibility of a presidential run.[218] Despite this, on March 18, NBC announced they were going ahead with production.[219] On June 29, after widespread negative reaction stemming from Trump's campaign announcement speech, NBC released a statement saying, \"Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump.\"[220] After Trump's election campaign and presidential win led to his departure from the program, actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced Trump as host for the fifteenth season.[221] Trump is still credited as an executive producer for the show.[222] Trump is a World Wrestling Entertainment fan and a friend of WWE chairman Vince McMahon. In 1988\u201389 Trump hosted WrestleMania IV and V at Boardwalk Hall (dubbed \"Trump Plaza\" for storyline purposes) and has been an active participant in several of the shows.[223] He also appeared in WrestleMania VII, and was interviewed ringside at WrestleMania XX.[224] Trump appeared at WrestleMania 23 in a match called \"The Battle of the Billionaires\".[223] He was in Bobby Lashley's corner, while Vince McMahon was in the corner of Lashley's opponent Umaga, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest referee.[223] The terms of the match were that either Trump or McMahon would have their head shaved if their competitor lost.[223] Lashley won the match, and so McMahon was shaved bald.[223] On June 15, 2009, McMahon announced as part of a storyline on Monday Night Raw that he had \"sold\" the show to Trump.[223] Appearing on screen, Trump declared that he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person and would give a full refund to the people who purchased tickets to the arena for that night's show.[223] McMahon \"bought back\" Raw the following week for twice the price.[223] In 2013, Trump was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame at Madison Square Garden for his contributions to the promotion. He made his sixth WrestleMania appearance the following night at WrestleMania 29.[225] As president, Trump appointed WWE CEO Linda McMahon to his Cabinet as Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[226] Trump has made cameo appearances in 12 films and 14 television series.[227] He played an oil tycoon in The Little Rascals,[228] and had a singing role at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2006.[229] Trump is a member of the Screen Actors Guild and receives an annual pension of more than $110,000.[230][231] His television reality show The Apprentice was twice (2004 and 2005) nominated for an Emmy Award.[232] Trump has been the subject of comedians, flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond and Alec Baldwin, and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode \"Bart to the Future\", written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform party, anticipated a future Trump presidency. A dedicated parody series called The President Show debuted in April 2017.[233] Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show on talk radio.[234] Trump also had his own daily talk radio program called Trumped!, from 2004 to 2008.[235][236][237] Since the 1980s, Trump's wealth and lifestyle have been a fixture of hip hop lyrics,[238] his name being quoted by more than 50 artists.[239] Trump first vaguely expressed interest in running for office in 1987, when he spent almost $100,000 to place full-page advertisements in several newspapers. In his view at that time, \"America should stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves\",[240] and \"should present Western Europe and Japan with a bill for America's efforts to safeguard the passage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.\"[241] According to a Gallup poll in December 1988, Trump was the tenth most admired person in America.[242][243] Trump considered running for president in 1988, 2000, 2004, and 2012, and for Governor of New York in 2006 and 2014, but aside from 2000 did not enter any of those races.[244][245] In February 2009, Trump appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and spoke about the automotive industry crisis of 2008\u201310. He said that \"instead of asking for money\", General Motors \"should go into bankruptcy and work that stuff out in a deal.\"[246] Trump publicly speculated about seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, and a Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll released in March 2011 found Trump leading among potential contenders; he was one point ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.[247] A Newsweek poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of incumbent president Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for president of the United States.[248] A poll released in April 2011 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for president while he was still actively considering a run.[249][250] His moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[251][252][253] Trump played a leading role in \"birther\" conspiracy theories that had been circulating since President Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.[254][255] Beginning in March 2011, Trump publicly questioned Obama's citizenship and eligibility to serve as president.[256][257][258] Although the Obama campaign had released a copy of the short-form birth certificate in 2008,[259] Trump demanded to see the original \"long-form\" certificate.[256] He mentioned having sent investigators to Hawaii to research the question, but he did not follow up with any findings.[256] He also repeated a debunked allegation that Obama's grandmother said she had witnessed his birth in Kenya.[260][261] When the White House later released Obama's long-form birth certificate,[262] Trump took credit for obtaining the document, saying \"I hope it checks out.\"[263] His official biography mentions his purported role in forcing Obama's hand,[264] and he has defended his pursuit of the issue when prompted, later saying that his promotion of the conspiracy made him \"very popular\".[265] In 2011, Trump had called for Obama to release his student records, questioning whether his grades warranted entry into an Ivy League school.[266] When asked in 2015 whether he believed Obama was born in the United States, Trump said he did not want to discuss the matter further.[267][268] In September 2016, Trump publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S., and said that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign.[257][269][270] Trump made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011. His appearance at CPAC was organized by GOProud, an LGBT conservative organization, in conjunction with GOProud supporter Roger Stone, who was close with Trump. GOProud pushed for a write-in campaign for Trump at CPAC's presidential straw poll. The 2011 CPAC speech Trump gave is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[271][272] In the 2012 Republican primaries, Trump generally had polled at or below 17 percent among the crowded field of possible candidates.[273] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election, while also saying he would have become the President of the United States, had he run.[251] In 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).[274] During the lightly attended early-morning speech, Trump spoke out against illegal immigration, then-President Obama's \"unprecedented media protection\", and advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.[275][276] Additionally, Trump spent over $1\u00a0million in 2013 to research a possible run for president of the United States.[277] In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. In response to the memo, Trump said that while New York had problems and that its taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him.[278] In January 2014, Trump made statements denying climate change that were discordant with the opinion of the scientific community.[279] A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election.[280] In February 2015, Trump told NBC that he was not prepared to sign on for another season of The Apprentice, as he mulled his political future.[281] Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times over the years. Trump was a Democrat prior to 1987.[282] In 1987, Trump registered as a Republican in Manhattan.[283] In 1999, Trump switched to the Reform Party and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001 due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.[284] From 2001 to 2008, Trump identified himself as a Democrat, but in 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for president. In 2009, he officially changed his party registration to Republican.[285] In December 2011, Trump became an independent for five months before returning to the Republican Party, where he later pledged to stay.[286][287] Trump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top ten recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans.[288] After 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats.[289] In February 2012, Trump openly endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for president.[290] When asked in 2015 which of the last four presidents he prefers, Trump picked Democrat Bill Clinton over the Republican Bushes.[291][292] According to a New York state report, Trump circumvented corporate and personal campaign donation limits in the 1980s\u2014although no laws were broken\u2014by donating money to candidates from 18 different business subsidiaries, rather than donating primarily in his own name.[293][294] Trump told investigators he did so on the advice of his lawyers. He also said the contributions were not to gain favor with business-friendly candidates, but simply to satisfy requests from friends.[293][295] In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in 2000.[284][296] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[297] Trump eventually dropped out of the race due to party infighting, but still went on to win the party's California and Michigan primaries.[298][299][300] On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in Manhattan. In the speech, Trump drew attention to domestic issues such as illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large priorities during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\".[301] In his campaign, Trump said that he disdained political correctness; he also stated that the media had intentionally misinterpreted his words, and he made other claims of adverse media bias.[302][303][304] In part due to his fame, Trump received an unprecedented amount of free media coverage during his run for the presidency, which elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.[305] Republican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan were hesitant to support him during his early quest for the presidency. They doubted his chances of winning the general election and feared that he could harm the image of the Republican Party.[306][307] The alt-right movement coalesced around Trump's candidacy,[308] due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[309][310] The connection of this group to the Trump campaign is controversial; writers such as Jon Ronson have suggested that the link between Trump and right-wing figures such as Alex Jones and Roger Stone is a marriage of convenience.[311] Trump personally condemned the alt-right in an interview after the election.[312] During the campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white nationalists,[313] especially in his initial refusal to condemn the support of David Duke\u2014a former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan\u2014in a CNN interview with Jake Tapper. He had previously criticized Duke in 1991, disavowed the 2000 Reform Party due to the support of Duke and others, and disavowed Duke on the campaign trail both before and after the interview.[314] In August, he appointed Steve Bannon\u2014the executive chairman of Breitbart News\u2014as his campaign CEO; the website was described by Bannon as \"the platform for the alt-right.\"[315] However, Bannon later told the Wall Street Journal that he was an \"economic nationalist\" but not \"a supporter of ethno-nationalism.\"[316] According to Michael Barkun, the Trump campaign was remarkable for bringing fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[317] Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on Trump supporters and vice-versa both inside and outside the venues.[318][319][320] Fact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates.[321][322][323] At least four major publications\u00a0\u2013 Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times\u00a0\u2013 have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements.[324] NPR said that Trump's campaign statements were often opaque or suggestive.[325] Lucas Graves, an assistant professor of journalism and mass communication at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison,[326] opined that Trump \"often speaks in a suggestive way that makes it unclear what exactly he meant, so that fact-checkers \"have to be really careful\" when picking claims to check, \"to pick things that reflect what the speaker was clearly trying to communicate.\"[327] Trump's penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth and where puffery abounds.[328] Trump has called his public speaking style \"truthful hyperbole\", an effective political tactic that may, however, backfire for overpromising.[328] Martin Medhurst, a Baylor University professor of communication and political science, analyzed Trump's frequently used rhetorical devices, such as catchy slogans, hyperbole, insinuations and preterition.[329] In compliance with FEC regulations of all presidential candidates, Trump published a 92-page financial disclosure form in 2015; the form listed all of his assets, liabilities, income sources and hundreds of business positions.[76] His decision not to release his tax returns[330] was contrary to usual practice by every presidential candidate since Gerald Ford in 1976.[331] Although there is no law that requires presidential candidates to release their returns,[332] Trump's refusal led to speculation that he was hiding something.[333] Trump explained that his tax returns were being audited and his lawyers had advised him against releasing the returns.[334][335] However, no law prohibits release of tax returns during an audit.[336] Tax attorneys differ about whether such a release is wise legal strategy.[337] Trump has told the news media that his tax rate was \"none of your business\", but added, \"I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.\"[338][339][340] On October 1, 2016, three pages of Trump's 1995 tax return were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times, who said she received the documents in her Times mailbox. Each of the three pages is one page from Trump's state filings in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. They show that using allowed deductions for losses, Trump claimed a loss of $916\u00a0million that year. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.[341] When asked if he used the tax code to avoid paying taxes, he said, \"Of course I did. Of course I did.\" He then went on to say he paid \"hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes\", calling it a \"simple\" thing. \"I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too\", he said.[342][343][344] On March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, who unveiled them on her show. The two pages showed that Trump paid $38\u00a0million in federal taxes and had a gross adjusted income of $150\u00a0million.[345][346] The White House confirmed the authenticity of the 2005 documents and stated: \"Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.\"[345][346] Trump entered a field of 17 major candidates who were vying for the 2016 Republican nomination; this was the largest presidential field in American history.[347] Trump participated in eleven of the twelve Republican debates, skipping only the January 28 seventh debate, which was the last debate before primary voting began on the first of February. The debates received historically high television ratings, which increased the visibility of Trump's campaign.[348] By early 2016, the race had mostly centered on Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.[349] On Super Tuesday, Trump won the plurality of the vote, and he remained the front-runner throughout the remainder of the primaries. By March 2016, Trump became poised to win the Republican nomination.[350] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016\u2014which prompted the remaining candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns\u2014RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[351] With nearly 14\u00a0million votes, Trump broke the all-time record in the history of the Republican Party for winning the most primary votes. He also set the record for the largest number of votes cast against the front runner.[352] After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump shifted his focus to the general election. He urged remaining primary voters to \"save [their] vote for the general election.\"[353] Trump began campaigning against Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016, and continued to campaign across the country. Clinton had established a significant lead over Trump in national polls throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton's lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI's re-opening of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy.[354][355][356] On July 15, 2016, Trump announced his selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate.[357] Four days later on July 19, Trump and Pence were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the Republican National Convention.[358] The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole, but the other prior nominees did not attend.[359][360] Two days later, Trump officially accepted the nomination in a 76-minute speech that was inspired by Richard Nixon's 1968 acceptance speech.[361] The historically long speech was watched by nearly 35\u00a0million people and received mixed reviews, with net negative viewer reactions according to CNN and Gallup polls.[362][363][364] On September 26, 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced off in their first presidential debate, which was held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. NBC News anchor Lester Holt was the moderator.[365] The TV broadcast was the most watched presidential debate in United States history.[366] The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning narrative of that debate was dominated by a leaked tape of Trump making lewd comments, and counter-accusations by Trump of sexual misconduct done by Bill Clinton. Trump had invited four women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to a press conference prior to the debate. The final presidential debate was held on October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Trump's refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular press attention.[367][368] Trump's campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.\u2013China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. His other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. During the campaign, he also advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS or IS). Media have described Trump's political positions as \"populist\",[369][370] and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation,[371] consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment,[372] usually considered a liberal (Democratic Party) policy.[373][374] According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a \"fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views\", but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[375][376] Trump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time.[377][378][379] Politico has described his positions as \"eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory\",[379] while NBC News counted \"141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues\" during his campaign.[380] In January 2017, American intelligence agencies \u2013 the CIA, FBI and NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence \u2013 jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government attempted to intervene in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[381][382] In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, former FBI Director James Comey affirmed he has \"no doubt\" that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, adding \"they did it with purpose and sophistication\".[383][384] Trump claims that the investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election is the pursuit of a false narrative, calling it \"the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!\"[385] Russian president Vladimir Putin echoed Trump's opinion, saying that Democrats cling to this fictitious explanation to avoid confronting their election loss.[386] There has been intensive media scrutiny of Trump's relationship to Russia.[387][388] During the campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a strong leader.[389][390] One of his campaign managers, Paul Manafort, had worked for several years to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovich win the Ukrainian presidency.[391] Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, have been connected to Russian officials.[392][393] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[394] Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[395] In a December 29, 2016 conversation, Flynn and Kislyak discussed the recently imposed sanctions against Russia; Trump later fired Flynn for falsely claiming he had not discussed the sanctions.[396] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that \"the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\"[397] In 2017, Trump and other senior White House officials asked the Director of National Intelligence, the NSA director, the FBI director, and two chairs of congressional committees to publicly dispute the news reports about contacts between Trump associates and Russia.[398] Two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women.[399][400][401] The hot mic recording was captured on a studio bus in which Trump and Billy Bush were preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. \"I just start kissing them,\" Trump said, \"I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything\u00a0... grab them by the pussy.\"[402] During the recording, Trump also spoke of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he \"moved on her very heavily.\"[402] These statements were recorded several months after Trump married his third and current wife, Melania, who was pregnant at the time.[402][403] Trump's language on the tape was described by the media as \"vulgar\", \"sexist\", and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident prompted him to make his first public apology during the campaign,[404][405] and caused outrage across the political spectrum,[406][407] with many Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of his candidacy and some urging him to quit the race.[408] Subsequently, at least 15 women[409] came forward with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping, resulting in widespread media coverage.[410][411] Trump and his campaign have denied all of the sexual misconduct accusations, which Trump has called \"false smears\", and alleged a conspiracy against him.[412][413][414] In his two public statements in response to the controversy, Trump responded by alleging that Bill Clinton, former President of the United States and husband of Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, had \"abused women\" and that Hillary had bullied her husband's victims.[415] On Election Day, November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232 votes. The counts were later adjusted to 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides, formalizing Trump's election to the presidency.[416] In the early hours of November 9, Clinton called Trump to concede the election. Trump then delivered his victory speech before hundreds of supporters in the New York Hilton hotel. The speech was in contrast with some of his previous rhetoric, with Trump promising to heal the division caused by the election, thanking Clinton for her service to the country, and promising to be a president to all Americans.[417][418] Trump received a smaller share of the popular vote than Clinton, making him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[419][nb 1] Clinton finished ahead by 2.86\u00a0million votes or 2.1 percentage points, 48.04% to 46.09%, with neither candidate reaching a majority nationwide.[422][423] Trump's victory was considered a stunning political upset, as polls consistently showed Hillary Clinton leading nationwide (which were consistent with her win in the popular vote) and in most battleground states, while Trump's support had been underestimated throughout his campaign.[424] The errors in some state polls were later partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton's support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump's support among white working-class voters.[425] Trump won the perennial swing states of Florida, Iowa and Ohio, and flipped Clinton's \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which had been Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Trump's victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control of both chambers of Congress, as was the case during parts of George W. Bush's presidency from 2003 to 2007. Trump is the wealthiest president in U.S. history.[426] He is also the first president without prior governmental or military experience.[427][428][429] Of the 43[nb 2] previous presidents, 38 had held prior elective office; two had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet; and three had never held public office but had been commanding generals.[429] Trump's election victory sparked protests across the United States. His opponents took to the streets to amplify their opposition to Trump's views and denounce his inflammatory statements. Trump initially said on Twitter that the protests consisted of \"professional protesters, incited by the media\", and were \"unfair\", but he later stated that he loves their passion for the country.[431][432] After Obama's re-election in 2012, Trump had tweeted \"We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!\"[433] On the Saturday following Trump's inauguration, massive demonstrations took place in the United States and worldwide in protest of Trump; approximately 2,600,000 people took part in Women's Marches worldwide.[434] One of these marches was the Women's March on Washington (in Washington, D.C.), where over 500,000 people marched in opposition to Trump.[435] On November 10, Trump had his first ever meeting with outgoing president Barack Obama to discuss plans for an orderly transition of power. The New York Times said, \"It was an extraordinary show of cordiality and respect between two men who have been political enemies and are stylistic opposites.\"[436] The BBC stated that \"their antipathy was barely concealed\" in \"awkward photos\" of the meeting.[437] New Jersey Governor Chris Christie led Trump's transition team until November 11, 2016, when Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over.[438] In the White House, Trump chose RNC chairman Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff;[439] he was replaced by retired Marine General John F. Kelly on July 28, 2017.[440] He appointed businessman and media executive Steve Bannon as White House Chief Strategist;[441] Bannon resigned on August 18, 2017 and no replacement has been named.[442] Trump's cabinet nominations included Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General,[443] financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury,[444] retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense,[445] and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.[446] Trump also brought on board politicians who had opposed him during the presidential campaign, notably neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[447] and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations.[448] While most of Trump's nominees were approved by the GOP majority in the Senate, the confirmation of education reform activist Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education[449] required Vice President Pence to cast a rare tie-breaking vote.[450] Most cabinet members were unable to take office on Inauguration Day because of delays in the formal confirmation process. Part of the lateness was ascribed to delays in submitting background-check paperwork, and part to obstructionism by Senate Democrats.[451] The last Cabinet member, Robert Lighthizer, took office as U.S. Trade Representative on May 11, 2017, more than four months after his nomination.[452] On November 22, Trump outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office in a video posted on YouTube. The plan included the United States' withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and asking the U.S. Department of Defense to develop a plan to protect the U.S. from cyber-attack.[453][454] On December 7, Time named Trump as its \"Person of the Year\".[455] In an interview on The Today Show, he said he was honored by the award, but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the \"President of the Divided States of America.\"[456][457] He also opposed Time's decision to change its \"Man of the Year\" title to \"Person of the Year\" in 1999, describing the action as too \"politically correct\".[458] On December 13 he was named Financial Times Person of the Year.[459] In December 2016, Forbes ranked Trump the second most powerful person in the world, after Vladimir Putin and before Angela Merkel.[460] Based on intelligence reports issued from October 2016 to January 2017, the Obama administration accused the Russian government of trying to influence the U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump, by supplying the DNC emails to WikiLeaks for publication.[461] Trump,[462] WikiLeaks[463] and Russian officials[464] have denied the allegations. Trump's inauguration as the 45th president was held on Friday, January 20, 2017. In his first week as president, Trump signed six executive orders. His first order as president set out interim procedures in anticipation of repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). That same week, Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, re-instated the Mexico City Policy, reopened the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects and signed an executive order to begin planning, designing and constructing a new Mexico border wall and reinforce border security.[465] On January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[466] The Senate confirmed the nomination on April 7 with a 54\u201345 vote.[467] On January 27, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns about terrorism. The order was imposed without warning and took effect immediately.[468] Confusion and protests caused chaos at many airports,[469] as travelers were detained on arriving in the United States or barred from boarding U.S.-bound planes.[470] The administration then clarified that visitors with a green card were exempt from the ban.[471][472] On January 30, Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General, directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the executive order and was promptly dismissed.[473] She was replaced as acting Attorney General by Dana Boente, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who agreed to enforce the order.[474] Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and on February 5 a federal judge in Seattle blocked its implementation.[475][476] On October 24, 2017, the Supreme Court dismissed the only remaining travel ban appeal as being moot because the revised order had expired. It expressed \"no views on the merits\" of the case.[477] On March 6, Trump issued a revised order, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, removed priorities for religious minorities (e.g. Christian refugees), and allowed for a week to implement legislation.[478][468] Again federal judges in Hawaii, Maryland and Virginia blocked its implementation.[479] On June 26, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the lower courts and allowed most provisions of the revised executive order to take effect. The Supreme Court ruled that Trump's ban can be enforced on visitors from targeted countries who lack a \"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\"[480] The court scheduled full hearings in October.[480] On September 24, 2017, the temporary executive order, which was close to expiry, was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea, Chad, and Venezuela (only on certain government officials and their families).[481] These provisions were slated to take effect on October 18,[481] and the Supreme Court cancelled the hearing that was planned for October 10.[482] On October 17, a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the portions of these provisions applying to the six Muslim-majority countries, leaving only the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela to take effect.[483] On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey. He attributed the action to recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein,[484] which criticized Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails.[485] On May 11, Trump stated that he was concerned with the ongoing \"Russia thing\"[486] and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[487] According to a Comey memo of a private conversation on February 14, 2017, Trump said he \"hoped\" Comey would drop the investigation into Michael Flynn,[488] who had been forced to resign as National Security Advisor after it was discovered that he had misled the Vice President about communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. In March and April, Trump had told Comey that the ongoing suspicions formed a \"cloud\" impairing his presidency,[489] and asked him to publicly state that he was not personally under investigation.[490] He also asked DNI Dan Coats and NSA Director Michael Rogers to issue statements saying there was no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.[491] Both refused, considering this an inappropriate request, although not illegal.[492] Comey eventually testified on June 8 that while he was director, the FBI investigations did not target Trump himself.[489][493] The Washington Post later reported that within days of Comey's dismissal, the FBI started investigating whether Trump had obstructed justice.[494] Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow stated that he had not been notified of any such investigation.[495] ABC News later reported that the special counsel is gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice but has not launched a full-scale investigation.[496] Trump attracted attention for implying that he had \"tapes\" of conversations with Comey, before later stating that he did not in fact have such tapes.[497] As president, Trump has frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks.[498][499][500] Trump uttered \"at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days\" in office according to The New York Times,[498] and 1,318 total in his first 263 days in office according to the \"Fact Checker\" political analysis column of The Washington Post,[501] which also wrote, \"President Trump is the most fact-challenged politician that The Fact Checker has ever encountered... the pace and volume of the president's misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up.\"[499] Trump's energy policy advocates domestic industrial support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter.[502] His appointed advisers favor a less regulated energy market and, because they do not consider climate change a threat, see no need for immediate action.[503] Trump does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.[504][505] In 2012, he said that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese, but later said that he was joking.[506][507] He has called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a \"disgrace\" and has threatened to cut its budget.[508] Trump pledged to eliminate the Clean Power Plan[509] and withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which calls for reductions in carbon emissions in more than 170 countries.[510] After winning the presidency, Trump said he had an \"open mind\" towards the Paris agreement,[511] but on June 1, 2017, he announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, making the United States one of only three nations at the time, besides Syria and Nicaragua, not to be members.[512] Trump's immigration policies were intensely discussed during the campaign. Trump vowed to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico\u2013United States border to keep out illegal immigrants, a wall that Trump promised Mexico would pay for.[513][514][515] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[516] and criticized birthright citizenship as it creates \"anchor babies\".[517] He said the focus of deportation would be criminals, those who have overstayed their visas, and other \"security threats\".[518] Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to completely ban Muslim non-citizens from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[519][520][521] Later in 2016 he stated that the ban would apply only to people originating from countries with a \"proven history of terrorism against the United States or its allies\", or countries \"compromised by terrorism\".[522][523][524] Shortly after coming into office, Trump issued a limited travel ban, which was suspended by federal courts and eventually came into effect following a June 2017 Supreme Court decision.[480] Trump is conservative, describes himself as pro-life, and generally opposes abortion; exceptions are made in cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[525] He has said that he is committed to appointing justices who would try to overturn the ruling in Roe v. Wade.[526] He personally supports \"traditional marriage\"[506] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a \"settled\" issue.[526] Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[527][528] although his views have shifted over time.[529] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[530] He favors capital punishment,[531][532] as well as the use of waterboarding.[533][534] In 1999, Trump told Larry King Live that \"I believe in universal healthcare.\"[535] Trump's 2000 book, The America We Deserve, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model,[536] and has voiced admiration for the Scottish National Health Service.[535][537][538] As a candidate Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare.[539][540] Starting early in his presidency he urged Congress to repeal and replace it. In May the United States House of Representatives voted to repeal the ACA.[541] However, the Senate tried for several months but was unable to pass any of several versions of a repeal bill.[542] Trump has expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\", and the Trump administration has cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[543][544][545] Trump aims to streamline the Department of Veterans Affairs, getting rid of backlogs and waitlists, and upgrading relevant facilities.[546] On his first Monday in office, Trump issued a federal hiring freeze on the VA.[547] Trump has stated his support for school choice and local control for primary and secondary schools.[548] He opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative for primary and secondary schools,[549] and has called it \"a disaster\" that must be ended.[550] He has stated he would abolish all or part of the Department of Education.[551] Trump's campaign tax plan called for levelling the corporate tax rate to 15%, eliminating various business loopholes and deductions,[371] and reducing the number of brackets for personal income tax: the top rate would be reduced from 39.6% to 25%, a large \"zero bracket\" would be created, and the alternative minimum tax and estate tax (which currently applies to individual estates over $5.45\u00a0million or $10.9\u00a0million per married couple) would both be eliminated.[552] His comments about the minimum wage have been inconsistent.[553][554][555] Trump identifies as a \"free trader\", but says that trade must be \"reasonably fair\".[556] He has often been called a \"protectionist\",[557][558][559] because of his criticism of NAFTA,[560][561] the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),[562] and his proposal to significantly raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States.[563][564] He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted.[565][566] However, Trump has been very keen to support a \"fair\" post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom,[567] which Trump says would be \"good for both sides\".[568] Trump's early policies have favored deregulation and a smaller federal government. He became the first president in sixteen years to sign a Congressional Review Act disapproval resolution; the law had been used only once before.[569] During his first six weeks in office, he abolished ninety federal regulations.[570][571] On January 23, 2017, Trump ordered a temporary government-wide hiring freeze, which allows for exceptions, primarily for jobs deemed vital for national security or public safety reasons.[572][573] The Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office told a House committee that hiring freezes have not proven to be effective in reducing costs.[574] Unlike some past freezes, the current freeze bars agencies from adding contractors to make up for employees leaving.[574] A week later Trump signed Executive Order 13771, directing administrative agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation they issue.[575][576] Harvard Law professor Jody Freeman said that the order would do no more than slow the regulatory process, because it did not block rules required by statute.[577] On February 24, 2017, Trump ordered the agencies to create task forces to determine which regulations are deemed burdensome to the U.S. economy.[578] Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump's criticisms, saying that the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups.[579] Trump has been described as non-interventionist[580][581] and nationalist.[582] He repeatedly stated that he supports \"America First\" foreign policy.[583] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[582] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[584] He says America should look inward, stop \"nation building\", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[581] As a candidate he questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[585] and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[586] But as president he has reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to NATO.[587] In order to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Trump in 2015 called for seizing the oil in ISIS-occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops.[588] In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region,[589][590] a position he later retracted.[591] Regarding the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is \"a big fan of Israel\".[592] During the campaign he said he would relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from its current location, Tel Aviv, although he has not pursued that proposal as president.[593] On May 22, 2017, Trump was the first U.S. president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem, during his first foreign trip, visiting Israel, Italy, the Vatican, and Belgium.[594] Both as a candidate and as president, Trump repeatedly said he wants a good relationship with Russia.[595][596] Trump has pledged to hold a summit meeting with Vladimir Putin.[597] He added that Russia could help the U.S. in fighting ISIS militants.[598] On April 7, 2017, Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian airfield in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[599] North Korea became a major issue in mid-2017. During the campaign and the early months of his presidency, Trump had hoped that China would help to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions and missile tests.[600] However, North Korea accelerated its missile testing, leading to an increase in tensions in April 2017.[600] In July, the country tested two long-range missiles identified by Western observers as intercontinental ballistic missiles, potentially capable of reaching Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland.[601][602] In August, Trump dramatically escalated his rhetoric against North Korea, warning that further provocation against the U.S. will be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen.\"[603] North Korean leader Kim Jong-un then threatened to direct the country's next missile test toward Guam. Trump responded that if North Korea took steps to attack Guam, \"[t]hings [would] happen to them like they never thought possible.\"[604] On July 12, 2017, California Representative Brad Sherman formally introduced an article of impeachment, H. Res. 438,[605] accusing the president of obstructing justice regarding the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.[606] Trump signaled his intention to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within hours of assuming the presidency.[607][608] This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one.[609] Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office.[610] By February 1, 2017, the campaign had already raised over $7\u00a0million.[611] SEN. MARTIN HEINRICH (D-NM): The president has repeatedly talked about ... Russia's involvement in the U.S. election cycle as \"a hoax\" and as \"fake news.\" ... JAMES COMEY: Yes, sir. There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever. The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle. They did it with purpose. They did it with sophistication. They did it with overwhelming technical efforts. And it was an active measures campaign driven from the top of that government. There is no fuzz on that. It is a high-confidence judgment of the entire intelligence community, and the members of this committee have seen the intelligence. It's not a close call. That happened. That's about as unfake as you can possibly get and is very, very serious, which is why it's so refreshing to see a bipartisan focus on that because this is about America, not about any particular party. HEINRICH: So that was a hostile act by the Russian government against this country? COMEY: Yes, sir.",

            "content": "New York is a state in the northeastern United States. New York was one of the original thirteen colonies that formed the United States. With an estimated 19.8 million residents in 2015,[9] it is the fourth most populous state in the United States. To differentiate from its city with the same name, it is sometimes called New York State. The state's largest city, New York City, makes up over 40% of the state's population. Two-thirds of the state's population lives in the New York metropolitan area, and nearly 40% lives on Long Island.[10] The state and city were both named for the 17th-century Duke of York, future King James II of England. With an estimated population of 8.55 million in 2015,[10] New York City is the most populous city in the United States and the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States.[11][12][13] The New York Metropolitan Area is one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[14][15] New York City is a global city,[16] home to the United Nations Headquarters[17] and has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital[18][19] of the world,[20][21][22] as well as the world's most economically powerful city.[23][22][24] The next four most populous cities in the state are Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers, and Syracuse, while the state capital is Albany. New York has a diverse geography. The state is bordered by New Jersey and Pennsylvania to the south and Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont to the east. The state has a maritime border with Rhode Island, east of Long Island, as well as an international border with the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the north and Ontario to the northwest. The southern part of the state is in the Atlantic Coastal Plain and consists of Long Island and several smaller associated islands, as well as New York City and the lower Hudson River Valley. The large Upstate New York region consists of several ranges of the wider Appalachian Mountains, and the Adirondack Mountains in the Northeastern lobe of the state. These more mountainous regions are bisected by two major river valleys\u2014the north-south Hudson River Valley and the east-west Mohawk River Valley. Western New York is considered part of the Great Lakes Region and borders Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, and Niagara Falls. The central part of the state is dominated by the Finger Lakes, a popular vacation and tourist destination. New York had been inhabited by tribes of Algonquian and Iroquoian-speaking Native Americans for several hundred years by the time the earliest Europeans came to New York. French colonists and Jesuit missionaries arrived southward from Montreal for trade and proselytizing. In 1609, the region was visited by Henry Hudson sailing for the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch built Fort Nassau in 1614 at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, where the present-day capital of Albany later developed. The Dutch soon also settled New Amsterdam and parts of the Hudson Valley, establishing the multicultural colony of New Netherland, a center of trade and immigration. England seized the colony from the Dutch in 1664. During the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), a group of colonists of the Province of New York attempted to take control of the British colony and eventually succeeded in establishing independence. Many landmarks in New York are well known, including four of the world's ten most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: Times Square, Central Park, Niagara Falls (shared with Ontario), and Grand Central Terminal.[25] New York is home to the Statue of Liberty, a symbol of the United States and its ideals of freedom, democracy, and opportunity.[26] In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship,[27] social tolerance,[28] and environmental sustainability.[29][30] New York's higher education network comprises approximately 200 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, Cornell University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.[31][32] The tribes in what is now New York were predominantly Iroquois and Algonquin. Long Island was divided roughly in half between the Wampanoag and Lenape. The Lenape also controlled most of the region surrounding New York Harbor. North of the Lenape was a third Algonquin nation, the Mohicans. Starting north of them, from east to west, were three Iroquoian nations: the Mohawk, the original Iroquois and the Petun. South of them, divided roughly along Appalachia, were the Susquehannock and the Erie.[33][34][35][36][37][38] Many of the Wampanoag and Mohican peoples were caught up in King Phillip's War, a joint effort of many New England tribes to push Europeans off their land. After the death of their leader, Chief Phillip Metcomet, most of those peoples fled inland, splitting into the Abenaki and the Schaghticoke. Many of the Mohicans remained in the region until the 1800s, [39] however, a small group known as the Ouabano migrated southwest into West Virginia at an earlier time. They may have merged with the Shawnee. [40] [41] The Mohawk and Susquehannock were the most militaristic. Trying to corner trade with the Europeans, they targeted other tribes. The Mohawk were also known for refusing white settlement on their land and banishing any of their people who converted to Christianity. They posed a major threat to the Abenaki and Mohicans, while the Susquehannock briefly conquered the Lenape in the 1600s. The most devastating event of the century, however, was the Beaver Wars. From approximately 1640\u20131680, Iroquoian peoples waged campaigns which extended from modern day Michigan to Virginia against Algonquin and Siouan tribes, as well as each other. The aim was to control more land for animal trapping, a career most natives had turned to in hopes of trading with whites first. Not only did this completely change the ethnography of the region, most large game was hunted out before whites ever fully explored the land. Still, afterward, the Iroquois Confederacy offered shelter to refugees of the Mascouten, Erie, Chonnonton, Tutelo, Saponi and Tuscarora nations. In the 1700s, they would also merge with the Mohawk during the French-Indian War and take in the remaining Susquehannock of Pennsylvania after they were decimated in war.[42] Most of these other groups blended in until they ceased to exist. Then, after the Revolution, a large group of them split off and returned to Ohio, becoming known as the Mingo Seneca. The current six tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy are the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Tuscarora and Mohawk. As the Iroquois sided with the British during the Revolution, they soon after migrated to Canada.[43][44] Meanwhile, the Lenape formed a close relationship with William Penn. However, upon Penn's death, his sons managed to take over much of their lands and banish them to Ohio.[45] When the U.S. drafted the Indian Removal Act, the Lenape were further moved to Missouri, whereas their cousins, the Mohicans, were sent to Wisconsin. Also, in 1778, the United States relocated the Nanticoke from the Delmarva Peninsula to the former Iroquois lands south of Lake Ontario, however they did not stay long. Mostly, they chose to migrate into Canada & merged with the Iroquois, although some moved west and merged with the Lenape. [46] In 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian explorer in the service of the French crown, explored the Atlantic coast of North America between the Carolinas and Newfoundland, including New York Harbor and Narragansett Bay. On April 17, 1524 Verrazanno entered New York Bay, by way of the strait now called the Narrows into the northern bay which he named Santa Margherita, in honor of the King of France's sister. Verrazzano described it as \"a vast coastline with a deep delta in which every kind of ship could pass\" and he adds: \"that it extends inland for a league and opens up to form a beautiful lake. This vast sheet of water swarmed with native boats\". He landed on the tip of Manhattan and possibly on the furthest point of Long Island. Verrazanno's stay was interrupted by a storm which pushed him north towards Martha's Vineyard.[47] In 1540 French traders from New France built a chateau on Castle Island, within present-day Albany; due to flooding, it was abandoned the next year. In 1614, the Dutch under the command of Hendrick Corstiaensen, rebuilt the French chateau, which they called Fort Nassau. Fort Nassau was the first Dutch settlement in North America, and was located along the Hudson River, also within present-day Albany. The small fort served as a trading post and warehouse. Located on the Hudson River flood plain, the rudimentary \"fort\" was washed away by flooding in 1617,[48] and abandoned for good after Fort Orange (New Netherland) was built nearby in 1623.[49] Henry Hudson's 1609 voyage marked the beginning of European involvement with the area. Sailing for the Dutch East India Company and looking for a passage to Asia, he entered the Upper New York Bay on September 11 of that year.[50] Word of his findings encouraged Dutch merchants to explore the coast in search for profitable fur trading with local Native American tribes. During the 17th century, Dutch trading posts established for the trade of pelts from the Lenape, Iroquois, and other tribes were founded in the colony of New Netherland. The first of these trading posts were Fort Nassau (1614, near present-day Albany); Fort Orange (1624, on the Hudson River just south of the current city of Albany and created to replace Fort Nassau), developing into settlement Beverwijck (1647), and into what became Albany; Fort Amsterdam (1625, to develop into the town New Amsterdam which is present-day New York City); and Esopus, (1653, now Kingston). The success of the patroonship of Rensselaerswyck (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the early success of the colony. The English captured the colony during the Second Anglo-Dutch War and governed it as the Province of New York. The city of New York was recaptured by the Dutch in 1673 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672\u20131674) and renamed New Orange. It was returned to the English under the terms of the Treaty of Westminster a year later.[51] The Sons of Liberty were organized in New York City during the 1760s, largely in response to the oppressive Stamp Act passed by the British Parliament in 1765. The Stamp Act Congress met in the city on October 19 of that year, composed of representatives from across the Thirteen Colonies who set the stage for the Continental Congress to follow. The Stamp Act Congress resulted in the Declaration of Rights and Grievances, which was the first written expression by representatives of the Americans of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the United States Declaration of Independence. This included the right to representative government. At the same time, given strong trading between Britain and the United States on both business and personal levels, many New York residents were Loyalists. The Capture of Fort Ticonderoga provided the cannon and gunpowder necessary to force a British withdrawal from the Siege of Boston in 1775. New York was the only colony to not vote for independence, as the delegates were not authorized to do so. New York then endorsed the Declaration of Independence on July 9, 1776.[52] The New York State Constitution was framed by a convention which assembled at White Plains on July 10, 1776, and after repeated adjournments and changes of location, terminated its labors at Kingston on Sunday evening, April 20, 1777, when the new constitution drafted by John Jay was adopted with but one dissenting vote. It was not submitted to the people for ratification. On July 30, 1777, George Clinton was inaugurated as the first Governor of New York at Kingston. About one-third of the battles of the American Revolutionary War took place in New York; the first major battle after U.S. independence was declared\u2014and the largest battle of the entire war\u2014was fought in New York at the Battle of Long Island (a.k.a. Battle of Brooklyn) in August 1776. After their victory, the British occupied New York City, making it their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict, and consequently the focus of General George Washington's intelligence network. On the notorious British prison ships of Wallabout Bay, more American combatants died of intentional neglect than were killed in combat in every battle of the war, combined. Both sides of combatants lost more soldiers to disease than to outright wounds. The first of two major British armies were captured by the Continental Army at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777, a success that influenced France to ally with the revolutionaries.The state constitution was enacted in 1777. New York became the 11th state to ratify the United States Constitution, on July 26, 1788. In an attempt to retain their sovereignty and remain an independent nation positioned between the new United States and British North America, four of the Iroquois Nations fought on the side of the British; only the Oneida and their dependents, the Tuscarora, allied themselves with the Americans.[53] In retaliation for attacks on the frontier led by Joseph Brant and Loyalist Mohawk forces, the Sullivan Expedition of 1779 destroyed nearly 50 Iroquois villages, adjacent croplands and winter stores, forcing many refugees to British-held Niagara.[54] As allies of the British, the Iroquois were forced out of New York, although they had not been part of treaty negotiations. They resettled in Canada after the war and were given land grants by the Crown. In the treaty settlement, the British ceded most Indian lands to the new United States. Because New York made treaty with the Iroquois without getting Congressional approval, some of the land purchases have been subject to land claim suits since the late 20th century by the federally recognized tribes. New York put up more than 5\u00a0million acres (20,000\u00a0km2) of former Iroquois territory for sale in the years after the Revolutionary War, leading to rapid development in upstate New York.[55] As per the Treaty of Paris, the last vestige of British authority in the former Thirteen Colonies\u2014their troops in New York City\u2014departed in 1783, which was long afterward celebrated as Evacuation Day.[56] New York City was the national capital under the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, the first government. That organization was found to be insufficient, and prominent New Yorker Alexander Hamilton advocated a new government that would include an executive, national courts, and the power to tax. Hamilton led the Annapolis Convention (1786) that called for the Philadelphia Convention, which drafted the United States Constitution, in which he also took part. The new government was to be a strong federal national government to replace the relatively weaker confederation of individual states. Following heated debate, which included the publication of the now quintessential constitutional interpretation\u2014The Federalist Papers\u2014as a series of installments in New York City newspapers, New York was the 11th state to ratify the United States Constitution, on July 26, 1788.[57] New York remained the national capital under the new constitution until 1790, and was the site of the inauguration of President George Washington, the drafting of the United States Bill of Rights, and the first session of the United States Supreme Court. Hamilton's revival of the heavily indebted United States economy after the war and the creation of a national bank significantly contributed to New York City becoming the financial center of the new nation. Both the Dutch and the British imported African slaves as laborers to the city and colony; New York had the second-highest population of slaves after Charleston, South Carolina. Slavery was extensive in New York City and some agricultural areas. The state passed a law for the gradual abolition of slavery soon after the Revolutionary War, but the last slave in New York was not freed until 1827. Transportation in western New York was by expensive wagons on muddy roads before canals opened up the rich farm lands to long-distance traffic. Governor DeWitt Clinton promoted the Erie Canal that connected New York City to the Great Lakes, by the Hudson River, the new canal, and the rivers and lakes. Work commenced in 1817, and the Erie Canal opened in 1825. Packet boats pulled by horses on tow paths traveled slowly over the canal carrying passengers and freight.[58] Farm products came in from the Midwest, and finished manufactured moved west. It was an engineering marvel which opened up vast areas of New York to commerce and settlement. It enabled Great Lakes port cities such as Buffalo and Rochester to grow and prosper. It also connected the burgeoning agricultural production of the Midwest and shipping on the Great Lakes, with the port of New York City. Improving transportation, it enabled additional population migration to territories west of New York. After 1850, railroads largely replaced the canal.[59] New York City was a major ocean port and had extensive traffic importing cotton from the South and exporting manufacturing goods. Nearly half of the state's exports were related to cotton. Southern cotton factors, planters and bankers visited so often that they had favorite hotels.[60] At the same time, activism for abolitionism was strong upstate, where some communities provided stops on the Underground Railroad. Upstate, and New York City, gave strong support for the American Civil War In terms of finances, volunteer soldiers, and supplies. The state provided more than 370,000 soldiers to the Union armies. Over 53,000 New Yorkers died in service, roughly one of every seven who served. However, Irish draft riots in 1862 were a significant embarrassment.[61][62] Since the early 19th century, New York City has been the largest port of entry for legal immigration into the United States. In the United States, the federal government did not assume direct jurisdiction for immigration until 1890. Prior to this time, the matter was delegated to the individual states, then via contract between the states and the federal government. Most immigrants to New York would disembark at the bustling docks along the Hudson and East Rivers, in the eventual Lower Manhattan. On May 4, 1847 the New York State Legislature created the Board of Commissioners of Immigration to regulate immigration.[63] The first permanent immigration depot in New York was established in 1855 at Castle Garden, a converted War of 1812 era fort located within what is now Battery Park, at the tip of Lower Manhattan. The first immigrants to arrive at the new depot were aboard three ships that had just been released from quarantine. Castle Garden served as New York's immigrant depot until it closed on April 18, 1890 when the federal government assumed control over immigration. During that period, more than 8 million immigrants passed through its doors (two out of every three U.S. immigrants).[64] When the federal government assumed control, it established the Bureau of Immigration, which chose the three-acre Ellis Island in Upper New York Harbor for an entry depot. Already federally controlled, the island had served as an ammunition depot. It was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to New York City and the rail lines of Jersey City, New Jersey, via a short ferry ride. While the island was being developed and expanded via land reclamation, the federal government operated a temporary depot at the Barge Office at the Battery.[65] Ellis Island opened on January 1, 1892, and operated as a central immigration center until the National Origins Act was passed in 1924, reducing immigration. After that date, the only immigrants to pass through were displaced persons or war refugees. The island ceased all immigration processing on November 12, 1954 when the last person detained on the island, Norwegian seaman Arne Peterssen, was released. He had overstayed his shore leave and left on the 10:15\u00a0a.m. Manhattan-bound ferry to return to his ship. More than 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954. More than 100 million Americans across the United States can trace their ancestry to these immigrants. Ellis Island was the subject of a contentious and long-running border and jurisdictional dispute between New York State and the State of New Jersey, as both claimed it. The issue was settled in 1998 by the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled that the original 3.3-acre (1.3\u00a0ha) island was New York State territory and that the balance of the 27.5 acres (11\u00a0ha) added after 1834 by landfill was in New Jersey.[66] The island was added to the National Park Service system in May 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson and is still owned by the Federal government as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Ellis Island was opened to the public as a museum of immigration in 1990.[67] On September 11, 2001, two of four hijacked planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, and the towers collapsed. 7 World Trade Center also collapsed due to damage from fires. The other buildings of the World Trade Center complex were damaged beyond repair and demolished soon thereafter. The collapse of the Twin Towers caused extensive damage and resulted in the deaths of 2,753 victims, including 147 aboard the two planes. Since September 11, most of Lower Manhattan has been restored. In the years since, many rescue workers and residents of the area have developed several life-threatening illnesses, and some have died.[68] A memorial at the site, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, was opened to the public on September 11, 2011. A permanent museum later opened at the site on March 21, 2014. Upon its completion in 2014, the new One World Trade Center became the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere, at 1,776 feet (541\u00a0m).[69] Other skyscrapers are under construction at the site. On October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive destruction of the state's shorelines, ravaging portions of New York City and Long Island with record-high storm surge, with severe flooding and high winds causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems. The storm and its profound effects have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of New York City and Long Island to minimize the risk from another such future event. This is considered highly probable due to global warming and rise in sea levels.[70][71] New York covers 54,555 square miles (141,300\u00a0km2) and ranks as the 27th largest state by size.[3] The highest elevation in New York is Mount Marcy in the Adirondacks, at 5,344 feet (1,629 meters) above sea level; while the state's lowest point is at sea level, on the Atlantic Ocean.[72] In contrast with New York City's urban landscape, the vast majority of the state's geographic area is dominated by meadows, forests, rivers, farms, mountains, and lakes. Most of the southern part of the state rests on the Allegheny Plateau, which extends from the southeastern United States to the Catskill Mountains; the section in New York State is known as the Southern Tier. The rugged Adirondack Mountains, with vast tracts of wilderness, lie west of the Lake Champlain Valley. The Great Appalachian Valley dominates eastern New York and contains the Lake Champlain Valley as its northern half and the Hudson Valley as its southern half within the state. The Tug Hill region arises as a cuesta east of Lake Ontario.[73] Upstate and downstate are often used informally to distinguish New York City or its greater metropolitan area from the rest of New York State. The placement of a boundary between the two is a matter of great contention.[74] Unofficial and loosely defined regions of Upstate New York include the Southern Tier, which often includes the counties along the border with Pennsylvania,[75] and the North Country, which can mean anything from the strip along the Canada\u2013US border to everything north of the Mohawk River.[76] New York contains a part of the Marcellus shale, which extends into Ohio and Pennsylvania.[77] Of New York State's total area, 13.6% consists of water.[78] Much of New York's boundaries are in water, as is true for New York City: four of its five boroughs are situated on three islands at the mouth of the Hudson River: Manhattan Island; Staten Island; and Long Island, which contains Brooklyn and Queens at its western end. The state's borders include a water boundary in (clockwise from the west) two Great Lakes (Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, which are connected by the Niagara River); the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in Canada, with New York and Ontario sharing the Thousand Islands archipelago within the Saint Lawrence River, while most of its border with Quebec is on land; it shares Lake Champlain with the New England state of Vermont; the New England state of Massachusetts has mostly a land border, while Connecticut has land and sea borders; New York extends into Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, sharing a water border with Rhode Island. Except for areas near the New York Harbor, New York has a mostly land border with two Mid-Atlantic states, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. New York is the only state that includes within its borders parts of the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. The Hudson River begins near Lake Tear of the Clouds and flows south through the eastern part of the state, without draining Lakes George or Champlain. Lake George empties at its north end into Lake Champlain, whose northern end extends into Canada, where it drains into the Richelieu River and then ultimately the Saint Lawrence River. The western section of the state is drained by the Allegheny River and rivers of the Susquehanna and Delaware River systems. Niagara Falls is shared between New York and Ontario as it flows on the Niagara River from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. The Delaware River Basin Compact, signed in 1961 by New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the federal government, regulates the utilization of water of the Delaware system.[79] In general, New York has a humid continental climate, though under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, New York City has a humid subtropical climate.[80] Weather in New York is heavily influenced by two continental air masses: a warm, humid one from the southwest and a cold, dry one from the northwest. Downstate New York, comprising New York City, Long Island, and lower portions of the Hudson Valley, has rather warm summers, with some periods of high humidity, and cold, damp winters which, however, are relatively mild compared to temperatures in Upstate New York, secondary to the former region's lower elevation, proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, and relatively lower latitude compared to the latter. Upstate New York experiences warm summers, marred by only occasional, brief intervals of sultry conditions, with long and cold winters. Western New York, particularly the Tug Hill region, receives heavy lake-effect snows, especially during the earlier portions of winter, before the surface of Lake Ontario itself is covered by ice. The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks, Catskills, and at higher elevations of the Southern Tier. Summer daytime temperatures usually range from the upper 70s to mid-80s \u00b0F (25 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C), over much of the state. In the majority of winter seasons, a temperature of \u221213\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221225\u00a0\u00b0C) or lower can be expected in the northern highlands (Northern Plateau) and 5\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221215\u00a0\u00b0C) or colder in the southwestern and east-central highlands of the Southern Tier. New York ranks 46th among the 50 states in the amount of greenhouse gases generated per person. This relative efficient energy usage is primarily due to the dense, compact settlement in the New York City metropolitan area, and the state population's high rate of mass transit use in this area and between major cities.[81] Due to its long history, New York has several overlapping and often conflicting definitions of regions within the state. The regions are also not fully definable due to colloquial use of regional labels. The New York State Department of Economic Development provides two distinct definitions of these regions; it divides the state into ten economic regions,[82] which approximately correspond to terminology used by residents: The department also groups the counties into eleven regions for tourism purposes:[83] New York has many state parks and two major forest preserves. Niagara Falls State Park, established in 1885, is the oldest state park in the United States[84] and the first to be created via eminent domain.[85] In 1892, Adirondack Park, roughly the size of the state of Vermont and the largest state park in the United States,[86] was established and given state constitutional protection to remain \"forever wild\" in 1894. The park is larger than Yellowstone, Everglades, Glacier, and Grand Canyon national parks combined.[86] It is larger than the Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Glacier, and Olympic National Parks combined.[87] The Catskill Park was protected in legislation passed in 1885,[88] which declared that its land was to be conserved and never put up for sale or lease. Consisting of 700,000 acres (2,800\u00a0km2) of land,[88] the park is a habitat for deer, minks, and fishers. There are some 400 black bears living in the region.[89] The state operates numerous campgrounds, and there are over 300 miles (480\u00a0km) of multi-use trails in the Park. The 1797 Montauk Lighthouse, commissioned under President George Washington, is a major tourist attraction in Montauk State Park at the easternmost tip of Long Island. Hither Hills State Park, also on the South Fork of Long Island, offers camping and is a popular destination with surfcasting sport fishermen. The State of New York is well represented in the National Park System with 22 national parks, which received 16,349,381 visitors in 2011. In addition, there are 4 National Heritage Areas, 27 National Natural Landmarks, 262 National Historic Landmarks, and 5,379 listings on the National Register of Historic Places. New York is divided into 62 counties. Aside from the five counties of New York City, each of these counties is subdivided into towns and cities, incorporated under state law. Towns can contain incorporated villages or unincorporated hamlets. New York City is divided into five boroughs, each coterminous with a county. Downstate New York (New York City, Long Island, and the southern portion of the Hudson Valley) can be considered to form the central core of the Northeast megalopolis, an urbanized region stretching from New Hampshire to Virginia. The major cities of the state developed along the key transportation and trade routes of the early 19th century, including the Erie Canal and railroads paralleling it. Today, the New York Thruway acts as a modern counterpart to commercial water routes.[95] The distribution of change in population growth is uneven in New York State; the New York City metropolitan area is growing considerably, along with Saratoga County.[98] New York City gained more residents between April 2010 and July 2014 (316,000) than any other U.S. city.[99] Conversely, outside of the Ithaca area, population growth in much of Western New York is nearly stagnant.[98] According to immigration statistics, the state is a leading recipient of migrants from around the globe. Between 2000 and 2005, immigration failed to surpass emigration, a trend that has been reversing since 2006. New York State lost two House seats in the 2011 congressional reapportionment, secondary to relatively slow growth when compared to the rest of the United States. In 2000 and 2005, more people moved from New York to Florida than from any one state to another, contributing to New York becoming the U.S.'s fourth most populous state in 2015, behind Florida, Texas, and California.[100] However, New York State has the second-largest international immigrant population in the country among the American states, at 4.2 million as of 2008[update]; most reside in and around New York City, due to its size, high profile, vibrant economy, and cosmopolitan culture. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of New York was 19,795,791 on July 1, 2015, a 2.16% increase since the 2010 United States Census.[9] Despite the open land in the state, New York's population is very urban, with 92% of residents living in an urban area,[101] predominantly in the New York City metropolitan area. Two-thirds of New York State's population resides in New York City Metropolitan Area. New York City is the most populous city in the United States,[102] with an estimated record high population of 8,550,405 in 2015,[10] incorporating more immigration into the city than emigration since the 2010 United States Census.[103] More than twice as many people live in New York City as in the second-most populous U.S. city (Los Angeles),[104] and within a smaller area. Long Island alone accounted for a Census-estimated 7,838,722 residents in 2015, representing 39.6% of New York State's population.[10][105][106][107][108] 6.5% of New York's population were under five years of age, 24.7% under 18, and 12.9% were 65 or older. Females made up 51.8% of the state's population. These are the ten counties with the largest populations as of 2010[update]:[109][110] There are 62 cities in New York. The largest city in the state and the most populous city in the United States is New York City, which comprises five counties (each coextensive with a borough): Bronx, New York County (Manhattan), Queens, Kings County (Brooklyn), and Richmond County (Staten Island). New York City is home to more than two-fifths of the state's population. Albany, the state capital, is the sixth-largest city in New York State. The smallest city is Sherrill, New York, in Oneida County. Hempstead is the most populous town in the state; if it were a city, it would be the second largest in New York State, with over 700,000 residents. The following are the top ten metropolitan areas in the state as of the 2010 Census:[111] The racial makeup of New York State as of the 2010 Census was:[117] Hispanic or Latino of any race were 17.6% of the population in 2010: 2.4% were of Mexican, 5.5% Puerto Rican, 0.4% Cuban, and 9.4% other Hispanic or Latino origin. According to the 2010\u20132015 American Community Survey, the largest ancestry groups were Italian (13.0%), Irish (12.1%), German (10.3%), American (5.4%), and English (5.2%).[120] The state's most populous racial group, non-Hispanic white, has declined as a proportion of the state population from 94.6% in 1940 to 58.3% in 2010.[121][118] As of 2011[update], 55.6% of New York's population younger than age 1 were minorities.[122] New York's robustly increasing Jewish population, the largest outside of Israel,[123] was the highest among states both by percentage and absolute number in 2012.[124] It is driven by the high reproductive rate of Orthodox Jewish families,[125] particularly in Brooklyn and communities of the Hudson Valley. New York is home to the second-largest African American population (after Georgia) and the second largest Asian-American population (after California) in the United States. New York's uniracial Black population increased by 2.0% between 2000 and 2010, to 3,073,800.[126] The Black population is in a state of flux, as New York is the largest recipient of immigrants from Africa,[115] while established African Americans are migrating out of New York to the southern United States.[127] The New York City neighborhood of Harlem has historically been a major cultural capital for African-Americans of sub-Saharan descent, and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn has the largest such population in the United States. Meanwhile, New York's uniracial Asian population increased by a notable 36% from 2000 to 2010, to 1,420,244.[126] Queens, in New York City, is home to the state's largest Asian-American population and is the most ethnically diverse county in the United States; it is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[128][129] New York's growing uniracial Hispanic-or-Latino population numbered 3,416,922 in 2010,[130] a 19% increase from the 2,867,583 enumerated in 2000.[131] Queens is home to the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States. In addition, New York has the largest Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Jamaican American populations in the continental United States. The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown (\u66fc\u54c8\u9813\u83ef\u57e0), in Brooklyn (\u5e03\u9c81\u514b\u6797\u83ef\u57e0), and around Flushing, Queens (\u6cd5\u62c9\u76db\u83ef\u57e0), are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County (\u62ff\u9a37\u7e23),[132] on Long Island (\u9577\u5cf6).[133] New York State has become the top destination for new Chinese immigrants, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into the state.[115][116][134][135][136] A new China City of America is also planned in Sullivan County.[137] Long Island, including Queens and Nassau County, is also home to several Little Indias (\u0932\u0918\u0941 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924) and a large Koreatown (\ub871 \uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc \ucf54\ub9ac\uc544\ud0c0\uc6b4), with large and growing attendant populations of Indian Americans and Korean Americans, respectively. Brooklyn has been a destination for West Indian immigrants of African descent, as well as Asian Indian immigrants. In the 2000 Census, New York had the largest Italian American population, composing the largest self-identified ancestral group in Staten Island and Long Island, followed by Irish Americans. Albany and the Mohawk Valley also have large communities of ethnic Italians and Irish Americans, reflecting 19th and early 20th-century immigration. In Buffalo and western New York, German Americans comprise the largest ancestry. In the North Country of New York, French Canadians represent the leading ethnicity, given the area's proximity to Quebec. Americans of English ancestry are present throughout all of upstate New York, reflecting early colonial and later immigrants. In 2010, the most common American English dialects spoken in New York, besides General American English, were the New York City area dialect (including New York Latino English and North Jersey English), the Western New England accent around Albany, and Inland Northern American English in Buffalo and western New York State. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York City,[139][140][141] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[142] As of 2010[update], 70.72% (12,788,233) of New York residents aged five and older reported speaking only English at home, while 14.44% (2,611,903) spoke Spanish, 2.61% (472,955) Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin), 1.20% (216,468) Russian, 1.18% (213,785) Italian, 0.79% (142,169) French Creole, 0.75% (135,789) French, 0.67% (121,917) Yiddish, 0.63% (114,574) Korean, and Polish was spoken by 0.53% (95,413) of the population over the age of five. In total, 29.28% (5,295,016) of New York's population aged five and older reported speaking a language other than English.[138] In 2010, the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) reported that the largest denominations were the Catholic Church with 6,286,916; Orthodox Judaism with 588,500; Islam with 392,953; and the United Methodist Church with 328,315 adherents.[143] Roughly 3.8 percent of the state's adult population self-identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. This constitutes a total LGBT adult population of 570,388 individuals.[147] In 2010, the number of same-sex couple households stood at roughly 48,932.[148] New York was the fifth state to license same-sex marriages, after New Hampshire. Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York City, stated that \"same-sex marriages in New York City have generated an estimated $259 million in economic impact and $16 million in City revenues\" in the first year after the enactment of the Marriage Equality Act\".[149] Same-sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011 and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter.[150] New York City is also home to the largest transgender population in the United States, estimated at 25,000 in 2016.[151] The annual New York City Pride March (or gay pride parade) traverses southward down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, ending at Greenwich Village, and rivals the Sao Paulo Gay Pride Parade as the largest pride parade in the world, attracting tens of thousands of participants and millions of sidewalk spectators each June.[152] In June 2017, plans were announced for the first official monument to LGBT individuals commissioned by the State of New York, in contrast to the Stonewall National Monument, which was commissioned by the U.S. federal government. The State monument is planned to be built in Hudson River Park in Manhattan, near the waterfront Hudson River piers which have served as historically significant symbols of New York's role as a meeting place and a safe haven for LGBT communities.[153] New York's gross state product in 2015 was $1.44 trillion. If New York State were an independent nation, it would rank as the 12th or 13th largest economy in the world, depending upon international currency fluctuations. However, in 2013, the multi-state, New York City-centered Metropolitan Statistical Area produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.4\u00a0trillion,[155] while in 2012, the corresponding Combined Statistical Area[156] generated a GMP of over US$1.55\u00a0trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve nations and eleven nations, respectively.[157] Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world.[22][23][158][159][160] Lower Manhattan is the third-largest central business district in the United States and is home to the New York Stock Exchange, on Wall Street, and the NASDAQ, at 165 Broadway, representing the world's largest and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, as measured both by overall average daily trading volume and by total market capitalization of their listed companies in 2013.[154][161] Investment banking fees on Wall Street totaled approximately $40 billion in 2012,[162] while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as $324,000 annually.[163] In fiscal year 2013\u201314, Wall Street's securities industry generated 19% of New York State's tax revenue.[164] New York City remains the largest global center for trading in public equity and debt capital markets, driven in part by the size and financial development of the U.S. economy.[165]:31\u201332[166] New York also leads in hedge fund management; private equity; and the monetary volume of mergers and acquisitions. Several investment banks and investment managers headquartered in Manhattan are important participants in other global financial centers.[165]:34\u201335 New York is also the principal commercial banking center of the United States.[167] Many of the world's largest media conglomerates are also based in the city. Manhattan contained approximately 520 million square feet (48.1 million m2) of office space in 2013,[168] making it the largest office market in the United States,[169] while Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the nation.[170] Silicon Alley, centered in New York City, has evolved into a metonym for the sphere encompassing the New York City metropolitan region's high technology and entrepreneurship ecosystem; in 2015, Silicon Alley generated over US$7.3 billion in venture capital investment.[27] High tech industries including digital media, biotechnology, software development, game design, and other fields in information technology are growing, bolstered by New York City's position at the terminus of several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines,[171] its intellectual capital, as well as its growing outdoor wireless connectivity.[172] In December 2014, New York State announced a $50 million venture-capital fund to encourage enterprises working in biotechnology and advanced materials; according to Governor Andrew Cuomo, the seed money would facilitate entrepreneurs in bringing their research into the marketplace.[173] On December 19, 2011, then Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced his choice of Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to build a US$2 billion graduate school of applied sciences on Roosevelt Island in Manhattan, with the goal of transforming New York City into the world's premier technology capital.[174][175] Albany,[176] Saratoga County,[177][178] Rensselaer County, and the Hudson Valley, collectively recognized as eastern New York's Tech Valley, have experienced significant growth in the computer hardware side of the high-technology industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector, digital electronics design, and water- and electricity-dependent integrated microchip circuit manufacturing,[177] involving companies including IBM and its Thomas J. Watson Research Center,[179] GlobalFoundries, Samsung, and Taiwan Semiconductor, among others.[176][180] The area's high technology ecosystem is supported by technologically focused academic institutions including Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the SUNY Polytechnic Institute.[176] In 2015, Tech Valley, straddling both sides of the Adirondack Northway and the New York Thruway, generated over US$163 million in venture capital investment.[27] The Rochester area is important in the field of photographic processing and imaging as well as incubating an increasingly diverse high technology sphere encompassing STEM fields, similarly in part the result of private startup enterprises collaborating with major academic institutions, including the University of Rochester and Cornell University.[181] Westchester County has developed a burgeoning biotechnology sector in the 21st century, with over US$1 billion in planned private investment as of 2016,[182][183] Creative industries, which are concerned with generating and distributing knowledge and information, such as new media, digital media, film and television production, advertising, fashion, design, and architecture, account for a growing share of employment, with New York City possessing a strong competitive advantage in these industries.[184] As of 2014[update], New York State was offering tax incentives of up to $420 million annually for filmmaking within the state, the most generous such tax rebate among the U.S. states. New York has also attracted higher-wage visual-effects employment by further augmenting its tax credit to a maximum of 35% for performing post-film production work in Upstate New York.[185] The filmed entertainment industry has been growing in New York, contributing nearly US$9 billion to the New York City economy alone as of 2015.[186] I Love New York (stylized I \u2764 NY) is a slogan, a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign and has been used since 1977 to promote tourism in the state of New York,[187] including New York City.[188] The trademarked logo is owned by New York State Empire State Development.[189] The Broadway League reported that Broadway shows sold approximately US$1.27 billion worth of tickets in the 2013\u20132014 season, an 11.4% increase from US$1.139 billion in the 2012\u20132013 season. Attendance in 2013\u20132014 stood at 12.21 million, representing a 5.5% increase from the 2012\u20132013 season's 11.57 million.[190] The I Love New York song is the state song of New York.[191] New York exports a wide variety of goods such as prepared foods, computers and electronics, cut diamonds, and other commodities. In 2007, the state exported a total of $71.1 billion worth of goods, with the five largest foreign export markets being Canada (US$15 billion), the United Kingdom (US$6 billion), Switzerland (US$5.9 billion), Israel (US$4.9 billion), and Hong Kong (US$3.4 billion). New York's largest imports are oil, gold, aluminum, natural gas, electricity, rough diamonds, and lumber. The state also has a large manufacturing sector that includes printing and the production of garments, mainly in New York City; and furs, railroad equipment, automobile parts, and bus line vehicles, concentrated in Upstate regions. New York is the nation's third-largest grape producing state, and second-largest wine producer by volume, behind California. The southern Finger Lakes hillsides, the Hudson Valley, the North Fork of Long Island, and the southern shore of Lake Erie are the primary grape- and wine-growing regions in New York, with many vineyards. In 2012, New York had 320 wineries and 37,000 grape bearing acres, generating full-time employment of nearly 25,000 and annual wages of over US$1.1 billion, and yielding US$4.8 billion in direct economic impact from New York grapes, grape juice, and wine and grape products.[192] New York is a major agricultural producer overall, ranking among the top five states for agricultural products including maple syrup, apples, cherries, cabbage, dairy products, onions, and potatoes. The state is the largest producer of cabbage in the U.S. The state has about a quarter of its land in farms and produced $3.4 billion in agricultural products in 2001. The south shore of Lake Ontario provides the right mix of soils and microclimate for many apple, cherry, plum, pear and peach orchards. Apples are also grown in the Hudson Valley and near Lake Champlain. A moderately sized saltwater commercial fishery is located along the Atlantic side of Long Island. The principal catches by value are clams, lobsters, squid, and flounder. The University of the State of New York accredits and sets standards for primary, middle-level, and secondary education in the state, while the New York State Education Department oversees public schools and controls their standardized tests. The New York City Department of Education manages the New York City Public Schools system. In 1894, reflecting general racial discrimination then, the state passed a law that allowed communities to set up separate schools for children of African-American descent. In 1900, the state passed another law requiring integrated schools.[193] At the level of post-secondary education, the statewide public university system is the State University of New York, commonly referred to as SUNY. New York City also has its own City University of New York system, which is funded by the city. The SUNY system consists of 64 community colleges, technical colleges, undergraduate colleges, and doctoral-granting institutions, including several universities. New York's largest public university is the State University of New York at Buffalo, which was founded by U.S President and Vice President Millard Fillmore.[194][195] The four SUNY University Centers, offering a wide array of academic programs, are the University at Albany, Binghamton University, Stony Brook University, and the University at Buffalo. Notable large private universities include the Columbia University in Upper Manhattan and Cornell University in Ithaca, both Ivy League institutions, as well as New York University in Lower Manhattan, and Fordham University in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Westchester County. Smaller notable private institutions of higher education include Rockefeller University, Mercy College, New York Institute of Technology, Yeshiva University, and Hofstra University. There are also a multitude of postgraduate-level schools in New York State, including Medical, Law, and Engineering schools. West Point, the service academy of the U.S. Army, is located just south of Newburgh, on the west bank of the Hudson River. During the fiscal 2013 year, New York spent more on public education per pupil than any other state, according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics.[196] New York has one of the most extensive and one of the oldest transportation infrastructures in the country. Engineering challenges posed by the complex terrain of the state and the unique infrastructural issues of New York City brought on by urban crowding have had to be overcome perennially. Population expansion of the state has followed the path of the early waterways, first the Hudson River and Mohawk River, then the Erie Canal. In the 19th century, railroads were constructed along the river valleys, followed by the New York State Thruway in the 20th century. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) is the department of the government of New York[197] responsible for the development and operation of highways, railroads, mass transit systems, ports, waterways, and aviation facilities within New York State. The NYSDOT is headquartered at 50 Wolf Road in Colonie, Albany County. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) is a joint venture between the States of New York and New Jersey and authorized by the US Congress, established in 1921 through an interstate compact, that oversees much of the regional transportation infrastructure, including bridges, tunnels, airports, and seaports, within the geographical jurisdiction of the Port of New York and New Jersey. This 1,500 square mile (3,900\u00a0km\u00b2) port district is generally encompassed within a 25-mile (40\u00a0km) radius of the Statue of Liberty National Monument.[198] The Port Authority is headquartered at 4 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. In addition to the well known New York City Subway system \u2013 which is confined within New York City \u2013 four suburban commuter railroad systems enter and leave the city: the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, Port Authority Trans-Hudson, and five of New Jersey Transit's rail lines. The New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) is the agency of the government of New York City[199] responsible for the management of much of New York City's own transportation infrastructure. Other cities and towns in New York have urban and regional public transportation. In Buffalo, the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority runs the Buffalo Metro Rail light-rail system; in Rochester, the Rochester Subway operated from 1927 until 1956, but fell into disuse as state and federal investment went to highways. The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (NYSDMV or DMV) is the governmental agency responsible for registering and inspecting automobiles and other motor vehicles, as well as licensing drivers in the State of New York. As of 2008[update], the NYSDMV has 11,284,546 drivers licenses on file[200] and 10,697,644 vehicle registrations in force.[201] All gasoline-powered vehicles registered in New York State are required to have an emissions inspection every 12 months, in order to ensure that environmental quality controls are working to prevent air pollution. Diesel-powered vehicles with a gross weight rating over 8,500\u00a0lb that are registered in most Downstate New York counties must get an annual emissions inspection. All vehicles registered in New York State must get an annual safety inspection. Portions of the transportation system are intermodal, allowing travelers to switch easily from one mode of transportation to another. One of the most notable examples is AirTrain JFK which allows rail passengers to travel directly to terminals at John F. Kennedy International Airport as well as to the underground New York City Subway system. The Government of New York embodies the governmental structure of the State of New York as established by the New York State Constitution. It is composed of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The Governor is the State's chief executive and is assisted by the Lieutenant Governor. Both are elected on the same ticket. Additional elected officers include the Attorney General, and the Comptroller. The Secretary of State, formerly an elected officer, is currently appointed by the Governor. The New York State Legislature is bicameral and consists of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly. The Assembly consists of 150 members, while the Senate varies in its number of members, currently having 63. The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the Governor's power to veto a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a two-thirds majority in favor of overriding in each House. The permanent laws of a general nature are codified in the Consolidated Laws of New York. The highest court of appeal in the Unified Court System is the Court of Appeals whereas the primary felony trial court is the County Court (or the Supreme Court in New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters including small claims, traffic ticket cases, and local zoning matters, and are the starting point for all criminal cases. The New York City courts make up the largest local court system. The state is divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, all of which are municipal corporations with respect to their own governments, as well as various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school districts, fire districts, and New York state public-benefit corporations, frequently known as authorities or development corporations. Each municipal corporation is granted varying home rule powers as provided by the New York Constitution. The state also has 10 Indian reservations. Capital punishment was reintroduced in 1995 under the Pataki administration, but the statute was declared unconstitutional in 2004, when the New York Court of Appeals ruled in People v. LaValle that it violated the state constitution. The remaining death sentence was commuted by the court to life imprisonment in 2007, in People v. John Taylor, and the death row was disestablished in 2008, under executive order from Governor Paterson. No execution has taken place in New York since 1963. Legislative efforts to amend the statute have failed, and death sentences are no longer sought at the state level, though certain crimes that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government are subject to the federal death penalty.[202][203][204] The State of New York sends 27 members to the House of Representatives[205] in addition to its two United States Senators. As of the 2000 census and the redistricting for the 2002 elections, the state had 29 members in the House, but the representation was reduced to 27 in 2013 due to the state's slower overall population growth relative to the overall national population growth.[206] From 2016, New York will have 29 electoral votes in national presidential elections (a drop from its peak of 47 votes from 1933 to 1953). New York is represented by Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand in the United States Senate and has the nation's third equal highest number of congressional districts, equal with Florida and behind California's 53 and Texas's 36. The state has a strong imbalance of payments with the federal government. According to the Office of the New York State Comptroller, New York State received 91 cents in services for every $1 it sent in taxes to the U.S. federal government in the 2013 fiscal year; New York ranked in 46th place in the federal balance of payments to the state on a per capita basis.[207] As of April 2016, Democrats represented a plurality of voters in New York State, constituting over twice as many registered voters as any other political party affiliation or lack thereof.[208] Since the second half of the 20th century, New York has generally supported candidates belonging to the Democratic Party in national elections. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama won New York State by over 25 percentage points in both 2012 and 2008. New York City, as well as the state's other major urban locales, including Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Yonkers, and Syracuse, are significant Democratic strongholds, with liberal politics. Rural portions of upstate New York, however, are generally more conservative than the cities and tend to favor Republicans. Heavily populated suburban areas downstate, such as Westchester County and Long Island, have swung between the major parties since the 1980s, but more often than not support Democrats. New York City is the most important source of political fundraising in the United States for both major parties. Four of the top five zip codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top zip code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money for the 2000 presidential campaigns of both George W. Bush and Al Gore.[209] The state of New York has the distinction of being the home state for both major-party nominees in three Presidential elections. The 1904 presidential election saw former New York Governor and incumbent President Theodore Roosevelt face Alton B. Parker, chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals. The 1944 presidential election had Franklin D. Roosevelt, following in his cousin Theodore's footsteps as former New York Governor and incumbent president running for re-election against then-current New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey. In the 2016 Presidential election, former United States Senator from New York Hillary Clinton, a resident of Chappaqua, was the Democratic Party nominee. The Republican Party nominee was businessman Donald Trump, a resident of Manhattan and a native of Queens.[210] New York City is an important center for international diplomacy.[211] The United Nations Headquarters has been situated on the East Side of Midtown Manhattan since 1952. New York State is geographically home to one National Football League team, the Buffalo Bills, based in the Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park. Although the New York Giants and New York Jets represent the New York metropolitan area and were previously located in New York City, they play in MetLife Stadium, located in East Rutherford, New Jersey. New York also has two Major League Baseball teams, the New York Yankees (based in the Bronx) and the New York Mets (based in Queens). Minor league baseball teams also play in the State of New York, including the Long Island Ducks, the Brooklyn Cyclones, and the Staten Island Yankees. New York is home to three National Hockey League franchises: the New York Rangers in Manhattan, the New York Islanders in Brooklyn, and the Buffalo Sabres in Buffalo. New York has two National Basketball Association teams, the New York Knicks in Manhattan, and the Brooklyn Nets in Brooklyn. New York is the home of a Major League Soccer franchise, New York City FC, currently playing in the Bronx. Although the New York Red Bulls represent the New York metropolitan area, they play in Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey. New York hosted the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid. The 1980 Games are known for the USA\u2013USSR ice hockey match dubbed the \"Miracle on Ice\", in which a group of American college students and amateurs defeated the heavily favored Soviet national ice hockey team 4\u20133 and went on to win the gold medal against Finland. Along with St. Moritz, Switzerland and Innsbruck, Austria, Lake Placid is one of the three cities to have hosted the Winter Olympic Games twice. New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics but lost to London. Several U.S. national sports halls of fame are or have been situated in New York. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is located in Cooperstown, Otsego County. The National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, Saratoga County, honors achievements in the sport of thoroughbred horse racing. The physical facility of the National Soccer Hall of Fame in Oneonta, also in Otsego County, closed in 2010, although the organization itself has continued inductions. The annual United States Open Tennis Championships is one of the world's four Grand Slam tennis tournaments and is held at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in the New York City borough of Queens.[212] Coordinates: 43\u00b0N 75\u00b0W\ufeff / \ufeff43\u00b0N 75\u00b0W\ufeff / 43; -75\ufeff (New York (state))",

            "content": "Bronx, Kings (Brooklyn), New York (Manhattan), Queens, Richmond (Staten Island) The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.[9] With an estimated 2016 population of 8,537,673[7] distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles (784\u00a0km2),[10][11] New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[12] Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world[13][14] with an estimated 23.7\u00a0million residents as of 2016.[5] A global power city,[15] New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital[16][17] of the world,[18][19][20][21][22] and exerts a significant impact upon commerce,[22] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, and sports. The city's fast pace[23][24] defines the term New York minute.[25] Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[26] New York is an important center for international diplomacy.[27] Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors,[28][29] New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of New York State.[30] The five boroughs \u2013 Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island \u2013 were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[31] The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States,[32] and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[33][34][35] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[34][36][37] New York City is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States,[38] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world.[39] In 2013, the tri-state New York Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.4\u00a0trillion.[40] If New York City were a country, it would have the 12th highest GDP in the world.[41] New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists of the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626.[42] The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664[42] and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[43] New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790.[44] It has been the country's largest city since 1790.[45] The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[46] and is a world symbol of the United States and its ideals of liberty and peace.[47] In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship,[48] social tolerance,[49] and environmental sustainability,[50][51] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity.[52] Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, and the city received a record 61 million tourists in 2016,[53] hosting three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013.[54] Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world.[55][56] Times Square, iconic as the world's \"heart\"[57] and its \"Crossroads\",[58] is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District,[59] one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections,[60][61] and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[62] The names of many of the city's bridges, skyscrapers,[63] and parks are known around the world. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world,[22][64][65][66] and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.[67][68] Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world.[69][70] Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere,[71][72] with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city.[73][74] Providing continuous 24/7 service,[75] the New York City Subway is one of the most extensive metro systems worldwide, with 472 stations in operation.[76][77][78] Over 120 colleges and universities are located in New York City, including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top universities in the world.[79][80]   In 1664, the city was named after then Duke of York, and future King of England James II. James had been named by his older brother Charles II as proprietor of the former territory of New Netherlands and its main city of New Amsterdam, which had recently been seized from the Dutch. During the Wisconsinan glaciation, the New York City region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 1,000 feet (300\u00a0m) in depth. The ice sheet scraped away large amounts of regolith, leaving the bedrock that serves as the geologic foundation for much of New York City today. Later on, movement of the ice sheet would contribute to the separation of what are now Long Island and Staten Island.[81] In the precolonial era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by various bands of Algonquian tribes of Native Americans, including the Lenape, whose homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included Staten Island; the western portion of Long Island, including the area that would become Brooklyn and Queens; Manhattan; the Bronx; and the Lower Hudson Valley.[82] The first documented visit into New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano, a Florentine explorer in the service of the French crown. He claimed the area for France and named it Nouvelle Angoul\u00eame (New Angoul\u00eame).[83] A Spanish expedition led by captain Est\u00eav\u00e3o Gomes, a Portuguese sailing for Emperor Charles V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 charted the mouth of the Hudson River, which he named R\u00edo de San Antonio (Saint Anthony's River). Heavy ice kept him from further exploration, and he returned to Spain in August. The Padr\u00f3n Real of 1527, the first scientific map to show North America's east coast continuously, was informed by Gomes' expedition and labeled the Northeastern U.S. as Tierra de Esteban G\u00f3mez in his honor.[84] In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered the New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company. He proceeded to sail up what the Dutch would name the North River (now the Hudson River), named first by Hudson as the Mauritius after Maurice, Prince of Orange. Hudson's first mate described the harbor as \"a very good Harbour for all windes\" and the river as \"a mile broad\" and \"full of fish.\"[85] Hudson sailed roughly 150 miles north,[86] past the site of present-day Albany, in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue.[85] He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company. In 1614, the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay would be claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland (New Netherland). The first non-Native American inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City was Juan Rodriguez (transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues), a merchant from Santo Domingo. Born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, he arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613\u20131614, trapping for pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch. Broadway, from 159th Street to 218th Street in Upper Manhattan, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.[87][88] A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624 \u2013 making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States[89] \u2013 with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam).[90][91] The colony of New Amsterdam was centered at the site which would eventually become Lower Manhattan. In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band,[92] for 60 guilders[93] (about $1,000 in 2006).[94] A disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.[95][96] Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[97] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (\"patroons\", or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swathes of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[98] Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639\u20131640, in an effort to bolster economy growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[97][99] In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During his tenure, the population of New Amsterdam grew from 2,000 to 8,000. Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however, he also earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups (including Quakers, Jews, and Lutherans) from establishing houses of worship.[100] The Dutch West India Company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between Stuyvesant and residents of New Amsterdam.[101] In 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops led by Colonel Richard Nicolls without bloodshed.[100][101] The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.[102] The English promptly renamed the fledgling city \"New York\" after the Duke of York (the future King James II of England).[103] The transfer was confirmed in 1667 by the Treaty of Breda, which concluded the Second Anglo-Dutch War.[104] On August 24, 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Dutch captain Anthony Colve seized the colony of New York from England at the behest of Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest and rechristened it \"New Orange\" after William III, the Prince of Orange. The Dutch would soon return the island to England under the Treaty of Westminster of November 1674.[105][106] Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some epidemics brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670.[107] By 1700, the Lenape population had diminished to 200.[108] New York experienced several yellow fever epidemics in the 18th century, losing ten percent of its population to the disease in 1702 alone.[109][110] New York grew in importance as a trading port while under British rule in the early 1700s. It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, more than any other city other than Charleston, South Carolina.[111] Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the American South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years. The 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to establish the freedom of the press in North America.[112] In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King's College in Lower Manhattan.[113] The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty organized in the city, skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there. The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within the modern-day borough of Brooklyn. After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made the city their military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces evacuated at the close of the war in 1783, they transported 3,000 freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia. They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean. The only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York occurred, a large conflagration on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including Trinity Church.[114] In 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. In 1789, the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each assembled for the first time, and the United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all at Federal Hall on Wall Street.[115] By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States. Under New York State's gradual abolition act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties.[117][118] Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-black population gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential United States founders as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate black children.[119] It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School. The city's black population reached more than 16,000 in 1840.[120] In the 19th century, the city was transformed by development relating to its status as a trading center, as well as by European immigration.[121] The city adopted the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, which expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Manhattan. The 1825 completion of the Erie Canal through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the Hudson River and the Great Lakes.[122] Local politics became dominated by Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish and German immigrants.[123] Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, John Keese, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Edgar Allan Poe. Public-minded members of the contemporaneous business elite lobbied for the establishment of Central Park, which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city. The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants, of whom over 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, upwards of a quarter of the city's population.[124] There was also extensive immigration from the German provinces, where revolutions had disrupted societies, and Germans comprised another 25% of New York's population by 1860.[125] Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called upon the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.[119] Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,835 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute,[126] led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.[119] The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and black people for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the New York City Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants.[125] According to historian James M. McPherson (2001), at least 120 people were killed. In all, eleven black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and New Jersey; the black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865, which it had last been in 1820. The white working class had established dominance.[125][127] Violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the docks area.[125] It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.[128] In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens.[129] The opening of the subway in 1904, first built as separate private systems, helped bind the new city together. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication. In 1904, the steamship General Slocum caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people on board. In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city's worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.[130] New York's non-white population was 36,620 in 1890.[131] New York City was a prime destination in the early twentieth century for African Americans during the Great Migration from the American South, and by 1916, New York City had become home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America. The Harlem Renaissance of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of Prohibition. The larger economic boom generated construction of skyscrapers competing in height and creating an identifiable skyline. New York became the most populous urbanized area in the world in the early 1920s, overtaking London. The metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in the early 1930s, becoming the first megacity in human history.[132] The difficult years of the Great Depression saw the election of reformer Fiorello La Guardia as mayor and the fall of Tammany Hall after eighty years of political dominance.[133] Returning World War II veterans created a post-war economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens. New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The United Nations Headquarters was completed in 1952, solidifying New York's global geopolitical influence, and the rise of abstract expressionism in the city precipitated New York's displacement of Paris as the center of the art world.[134] The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan. They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement[137][138][139] and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.[140][141] In the 1970s, job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates.[142] While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.[143] By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the city's economy. New York's population reached all-time highs in the 2000 Census and then again in the 2010 Census. The city and surrounding area suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks when 10 of the 19 terrorists associated with Al-Qaeda piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center, and later destroyed them, killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and in the surrounding area. The North Tower was subsequently the tallest building ever to be destroyed and still is.[144] The rebuilding of the area, has created a new One World Trade Center, and a 9/11 memorial and museum along with other new buildings and infrastructure. The World Trade Center PATH station, which opened on July 19, 1909 as the Hudson Terminal, was also destroyed in the attack. A temporary station was built and opened on November 23, 2003. An 800,000-square-foot (74,000\u00a0m2) permanent station designed by Santiago Calatrava, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the city's third-largest hub, was completed in 2016.[145] The new One World Trade Center is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere[146] and the fourth-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height, with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet (541.3\u00a0m) in reference to the year of American independence.[147][148][149][150] The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and popularizing the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.[151] New York City is situated in the Northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston.[152] The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island. The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary.[153] The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey. The East River\u2014a tidal strait\u2014flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely fresh water river in the city.[154] The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s.[155] Some of the natural relief in topography has been evened out, especially in Manhattan.[156] The city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37\u00a0km2), including 302.643\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (783.84\u00a0km2) of land and 165.841\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (429.53\u00a0km2) of this is water.[157][158] The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9\u00a0m) above sea level, is the highest point on the Eastern Seaboard south of Maine.[159] The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.[160] New York has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the saltbox style Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn, the oldest section of which dates to 1656, to the modern One World Trade Center, the skyscraper at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan and the most expensive office tower in the world by construction cost.[161] Manhattan's skyline, with its many skyscrapers, is universally recognized, and the city has been home to several of the tallest buildings in the world. As of 2011[update], New York City had 5,937 high-rise buildings, of which 550 completed structures were at least 330 feet (100\u00a0m) high, both second in the world after Hong Kong,[162][163] with over 50 completed skyscrapers taller than 656 feet (200\u00a0m). These include the Woolworth Building, an early example of Gothic Revival architecture in skyscraper design, built with massively scaled Gothic detailing; completed in 1913, for 17 years it was the world's tallest building.[164] The 1916 Zoning Resolution required setbacks in new buildings and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below.[165] The Art Deco style of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The buildings have distinctive ornamentation, such as the eagles at the corners of the 61st floor on the Chrysler Building, and are considered some of the finest examples of the Art Deco style.[166] A highly influential example of the international style in the United States is the Seagram Building (1957), distinctive for its fa\u00e7ade using visible bronze-toned I-beams to evoke the building's structure. The Cond\u00e9 Nast Building (2000) is a prominent example of green design in American skyscrapers[167] and has received an award from the American Institute of Architects and AIA New York State for its design. The character of New York's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930.[168] In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In neighborhoods such as Riverdale (in the Bronx), Ditmas Park (in Brooklyn), and Douglaston (in Queens), large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian.[169][170][171] Stone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835.[172] A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings is the wooden roof-mounted water towers. In the 1800s, the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations, which could break municipal water pipes.[173] Garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, such as Jackson Heights.[174] According to the United States Geological Survey, an updated analysis of seismic hazard in July 2014 revealed a \"slightly lower hazard for tall buildings\" in New York City than previously assessed. Scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near the city, which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city.[175] New York City is often referred to collectively as the five boroughs, and in turn, there are hundreds of distinct neighborhoods throughout the boroughs, many with a definable history and character to call their own. If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States (Staten island would be ranked 37th)\u00a0; these same boroughs are coterminous with the four most densely populated counties in the United States (New York [Manhattan], Kings [Brooklyn], Bronx, and Queens). Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, using the 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) isotherm, New York City features a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), and is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization.[196][197] The suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the transitional zone between humid subtropical and humid continental climates (Dfa).[196][197] Annually, the city averages 234 days with at least some sunshine.[198] The city lies in the USDA 7b plant hardiness zone.[199] Winters are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore temper the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. The daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 32.6\u00a0\u00b0F (0.3\u00a0\u00b0C);[200] temperatures usually drop to 10\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212\u00a0\u00b0C) several times per winter,[200][201] and reach 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C) several days in the coldest winter month.[200] Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from chilly to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically warm to hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 76.5\u00a0\u00b0F (24.7\u00a0\u00b0C) in July.[200] Nighttime conditions are often exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon, while daytime temperatures exceed 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) on average of 17 days each summer[202] and in some years exceed 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C). Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221215\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221226\u00a0\u00b0C), recorded on February 9, 1934, up to 106\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 9, 1936.[202] The average water temperature of the nearby Atlantic Ocean ranges from 39.7\u00a0\u00b0F (4.3\u00a0\u00b0C) in February to 74.1\u00a0\u00b0F (23.4\u00a0\u00b0C) in August.[203] The city receives 49.9 inches (1,270\u00a0mm) of precipitation annually, which is relatively evenly spread throughout the year. Average winter snowfall between 1981 and 2010 has been 25.8 inches (66\u00a0cm); this varies considerably from year to year.[202] Hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the New York area.[204] Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs.[205] The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.[206][207]  See Geography of New York City for additional climate information from the outer boroughs.

The City of New York has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the National Park Service, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, the Trust for Public Land reported that the park system in New York City was the second best park system among the 50 most populous US cities, behind the park system of Minneapolis.[211] ParkScore ranks urban park systems by a formula that analyzes median park size, park acres as percent of city area, the percent of city residents within a half-mile of a park, spending of park services per resident, and the number of playgrounds per 10,000 residents. Gateway National Recreation Area contains over 26,000 acres (10,521.83\u00a0ha) in total, most of it surrounded by New York City,[213] including the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. In Brooklyn and Queens, the park contains over 9,000 acres (36\u00a0km2) of salt marsh, wetlands, islands, and water, including most of Jamaica Bay. Also in Queens, the park includes a significant portion of the western Rockaway Peninsula, most notably Jacob Riis Park and Fort Tilden. In Staten Island, Gateway National Recreation Area includes Fort Wadsworth, with historic pre-Civil War era Battery Weed and Fort Tompkins, and Great Kills Park, with beaches, trails, and a marina. The Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island Immigration Museum are managed by the National Park Service and are in both the states of New York and New Jersey. They are joined in the harbor by Governors Island National Monument, in New York. Historic sites under federal management on Manhattan Island include Castle Clinton National Monument; Federal Hall National Memorial; Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site; General Grant National Memorial (\"Grant's Tomb\"); African Burial Ground National Monument; and Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Hundreds of private properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a National Historic Landmark such as, for example, the Stonewall Inn, part of the Stonewall National Monument in Greenwich Village, as the catalyst of the modern gay rights movement.[137][138][139][140][141] There are seven state parks within the confines of New York City, including Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve, a natural area that includes extensive riding trails, and Riverbank State Park, a 28-acre (110,000\u00a0m2) facility that rises 69 feet (21\u00a0m) over the Hudson River.[214] New York City has over 28,000 acres (110\u00a0km2) of municipal parkland and 14 miles (23\u00a0km) of public beaches.[215] The largest municipal park in the city is Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, with 2,772 acres (1,122\u00a0ha).[194][216] New York City is home to Fort Hamilton, the U.S. military's only active duty installation within the city.[227] Established in 1825 in Brooklyn on the site of a small battery utilized during the American Revolution, it is one of America's longest serving military forts.[228] Today Fort Hamilton serves as the headquarters of the North Atlantic Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and for the New York City Recruiting Battalion. It also houses the 1179th Transportation Brigade, the 722nd Aeromedical Staging Squadron, and a military entrance processing station. Other formerly active military reservations still utilized for National Guard and military training or reserve operations in the city include Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island and Fort Totten in Queens. New York City is the most populous city in the United States,[9] with an estimated record high of 8,537,673 residents as of 2016[update],[7] incorporating more immigration into the city than outmigration since the 2010 United States Census.[242][243] More than twice as many people live in New York City as in the second-most populous U.S. city (Los Angeles),[9] and within a smaller area. New York City gained more residents between April 2010 and July 2014 (316,000) than any other U.S. city.[9] New York City's population is about 43% of New York State's population[244] and about 36% of the population of the New York metropolitan area.[245] In 2015, the city had an estimated population density of 28,053 people per square mile (10,756/km\u00b2), rendering it the most densely populated of all municipalities housing over 100,000 residents in the United States, with several small cities (of fewer than 100,000) in adjacent Hudson County, New Jersey having greater density, as per the 2010 Census.[246] Geographically co-extensive with New York County, the borough of Manhattan's 2015 population density of 69,468 inhabitants per square mile (26,822/km2)[247] makes it the highest of any county in the United States[248][249] and higher than the density of any individual American city.[250] The city's population in 2010 was 44% white (33.3% non-Hispanic white), 25.5% black (23% non-Hispanic black), 0.7% Native American, and 12.7% Asian.[251] Hispanics of any race represented 28.6% of the population,[251] while Asians constituted the fastest-growing segment of the city's population between 2000 and 2010; the non-Hispanic white population declined 3 percent, the smallest recorded decline in decades; and for the first time since the Civil War, the number of blacks declined over a decade.[252] Throughout its history, the city has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States; more than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924.[253] The term \"melting pot\" was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. By 1900, Germans constituted the largest immigrant group, followed by the Irish, Jews, and Italians.[254] In 1940, whites represented 92% of the city's population.[231] Approximately 37% of the city's population is foreign born and more than half of all children are born to mothers who are immigrants.[255][256] In New York, no single country or region of origin dominates.[255] The ten largest sources of foreign-born individuals in the city as of 2011[update] were the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, and Trinidad and Tobago,[257] while the Bangladeshi-born immigrant population has become one of the fastest growing in the city, counting over 74,000 by 2011.[39][258] Asian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 Census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles.[259] New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper.[260] The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean (Colombian, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Bolivian) populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.[187][188] The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown, in Brooklyn, and around Flushing, Queens, are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves \u2013 while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County[261] on Long Island,[262] as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas,[32][263][264][265][266][267] with the largest metropolitan Chinese diaspora outside Asia,[39][268] including an estimated 812,410 individuals in 2015.[269] In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island.[270] A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese (Chaoxianzu or Joseonjok) is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens.[271] Koreans made up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%. Filipinos were the largest Southeast Asian ethnic group at 0.8%, followed by Vietnamese, who made up 0.2% of New York City's population in 2010. Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively.[272] Queens is the preferred borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, Filipinos,[273] and Malaysians[32] and other Southeast Asians;[274] while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers of both West Indian and Asian Indian immigrants. New York City has the largest European and non-Hispanic white population of any American city. At 2.7 million in 2012, New York's non-Hispanic white population is larger than the non-Hispanic white populations of Los Angeles (1.1 million), Chicago (865,000), and Houston (550,000) combined.[275] The non-Hispanic white population was 6.6 million in 1940.[276] The non-Hispanic white population has begun to increase since 2010.[277] The European diaspora residing in the city is very diverse. According to 2012 Census estimates, there were roughly 560,000 Italian Americans, 385,000 Irish Americans, 253,000 German Americans, 223,000 Russian Americans, 201,000 Polish Americans, and 137,000 English Americans. Additionally, Greek and French Americans numbered 65,000 each, with those of Hungarian descent estimated at 60,000 people. Ukrainian and Scottish Americans numbered 55,000 and 35,000, respectively. People identifying ancestry from Spain numbered 30,838 total in 2010.[278] People of Norwegian and Swedish descent both stood at about 20,000 each, while people of Czech, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Scotch-Irish, and Welsh descent all numbered between 12,000\u201314,000 people.[279] Arab Americans number over 160,000 in New York City,[280] with the highest concentration in Brooklyn. Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment of the city's non-Hispanic white population, enumerating over 30,000, and including over half of all Central Asian immigrants to the United States,[281] most settling in Queens or Brooklyn. Albanian Americans are most highly concentrated in the Bronx.[282] The wider New York City metropolitan statistical area, with over 20 million people, about 50% greater than the second-place Los Angeles metropolitan area in the United States,[4] is also ethnically diverse,[283] with the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States, substantially exceeding the combined totals of Los Angeles and Miami.[32] It is home to the largest Jewish and Israeli communities outside Israel, with the Jewish population in the region numbering over 1.5 million in 2012 and including many diverse Jewish sects from around the Middle East and Eastern Europe.[271] The metropolitan area is also home to 20% of the nation's Indian Americans and at least 20 Little India enclaves, and 15% of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns;[284][285] the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest Russian American,[263] Italian American, and African American populations; the largest Dominican American, Puerto Rican American, and South American[263] and second-largest overall Hispanic population in the United States, numbering 4.8 million;[278] and includes multiple established Chinatowns within New York City alone.[286] Ecuador, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, and Brazil were the top source countries from South America for legal immigrants to the New York City region in 2013; the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean; Egypt, Ghana, and Nigeria from Africa; and El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala in Central America.[287] Amidst a resurgence of Puerto Rican migration to New York City, this population had increased to approximately 1.3 million in the metropolitan area as of 2013[update]. The New York metropolitan area is home to a prominent self-identifying gay and bisexual community estimated at nearly 570,000 individuals, the largest in the United States and one of the world's largest.[291][292] Same-sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011 and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter.[293] Charles Kaiser, author of The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America, wrote that in the era after World War II, \"New York City became the literal gay metropolis for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from within and without the United States: the place they chose to learn how to live openly, honestly and without shame.\"[294] The annual New York City Pride March (or gay pride parade) traverses southward down Fifth Avenue and ends at Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan; the parade rivals the Sao Paulo Gay Pride Parade as the largest pride parade in the world, attracting tens of thousands of participants and millions of sidewalk spectators each June.[295] Wayne R. Dynes, author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, wrote that drag queens were the only \"transgender folks around\" during the June 1969 Stonewall riots. \"None of them in fact made a major contribution to the movement.\"[296] Others say the transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality during the period of the Stonewall riots and thereafter.[296] New York City is home to the largest transgender population in the United States, estimated at 25,000 in 2016.[297] However, until the Stonewall riots, this community had felt marginalized and neglected by the gay community.[296] Christianity (59%) \u2014 made up of Roman Catholicism (33%), Protestantism (23%), and other Christians (3%) \u2014 is the most prevalent religion in New York, as of 2014[update].[298] It is followed by Judaism, with approximately 1.1 million adherents,[299][300] over half of whom live in Brooklyn.[301] The Jewish population makes up 18.4% of the city.[302] Islam ranks third in New York City, with official estimates ranging between 600,000 and 1,000,000 observers, including 10% of the city's public school children.[303] These three largest groups are followed by Hinduism, Buddhism, and a variety of other religions, as well as atheism. In 2014, 24% of New Yorkers self-identified with no organized religious affiliation.[298] New York City has a high degree of income disparity as indicated by its Gini Coefficient of 0.5 for the city overall and 0.6 for Manhattan.[304] In the first quarter of 2014, the average weekly wage in New York County (Manhattan) was $2,749, representing the highest total among large counties in the United States.[305] As of 2017, New York City had the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world at 82, with a combined net worth of US$398 billion,[306] including former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.[307] New York also had the highest density of millionaires per capita among major U.S. cities in 2014, at 4.6% of residents.[308] Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom, with the area south of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010, 12% greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001.[309] New York is a global hub of business and commerce. The city is a major center for banking and finance, retailing, world trade, transportation, tourism, real estate, new media, traditional media, advertising, legal services, accountancy, insurance, theater, fashion, and the arts in the United States; while Silicon Alley, metonymous for New York's broad-spectrum high technology sphere, continues to expand. The Port of New York and New Jersey is also a major economic engine, handling record cargo volume in the first half of 2014.[311] In February 2017, New York City's unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, the lowest in the city's recorded history, with the city achieving the status of what many economists refer to as full employment.[312] Many Fortune 500 corporations are headquartered in New York City,[313] as are a large number of multinational corporations. One out of ten private sector jobs in the city is with a foreign company.[314] New York City has been ranked first among cities across the globe in attracting capital, business, and tourists.[315][316] This ability to attract foreign investment helped New York City top the FDi Magazine American Cities of the Future ranking for 2013.[317] Real estate is a major force in the city's economy, as the total value of all New York City property was assessed at US$1.072 trillion for the 2017 fiscal year, an increase of 10.6% from the previous year with 89% of the increase coming from market effects.[318] The Time Warner Center is the property with the highest-listed market value in the city, at US$1.1\u00a0billion in 2006.[318] New York City is home to some of the nation's\u2014and the world's\u2014most valuable real estate. 450 Park Avenue was sold on July 2, 2007 for US$510\u00a0million, about $1,589 per square foot ($17,104/m\u00b2), breaking the barely month-old record for an American office building of $1,476 per square foot ($15,887/m\u00b2) set in the June 2007 sale of 660 Madison Avenue.[319] According to Forbes, in 2014, Manhattan was home to six of the top ten zip codes in the United States by median housing price.[320] Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commands the highest retail rents in the world, at US$3,000 per square foot ($32,000/m2) in 2017.[321] As of 2013[update], the global advertising agencies of Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group, both based in Manhattan, had combined annual revenues of approximately US$21 billion, reflecting New York City's role as the top global center for the advertising industry, which is metonymously referred to as \"Madison Avenue\".[322] The city's fashion industry provides approximately 180,000 employees with $11 billion in annual wages.[323] Other important sectors include medical research and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities. Manufacturing accounts for a significant but declining share of employment, although the city's garment industry is showing a resurgence in Brooklyn.[324] Food processing is a US$5\u00a0billion industry that employs more than 19,000 residents. Chocolate is New York City's leading specialty-food export, with up to US$234\u00a0million worth of exports each year.[325] Entrepreneurs were forming a \"Chocolate District\" in Brooklyn as of 2014[update],[326] while Godiva, one of the world's largest chocolatiers, continues to be headquartered in Manhattan.[327] New York City's most important economic sector lies in its role as the headquarters for the U.S. financial industry, metonymously known as Wall Street. The city's securities industry, enumerating 163,400 jobs in August 2013, continues to form the largest segment of the city's financial sector and an important economic engine, accounting in 2012 for 5 percent of the city's private sector jobs, 8.5 percent (US$3.8 billion) of its tax revenue, and 22 percent of the city's total wages, including an average salary of US$360,700.[328] Many large financial companies are headquartered in New York City, and the city is also home to a burgeoning number of financial startup companies. Lower Manhattan is home to the New York Stock Exchange, on Wall Street, and the NASDAQ, at 165 Broadway, representing the world's largest and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, when measured both by overall average daily trading volume and by total market capitalization of their listed companies in 2013.[67][68] Investment banking fees on Wall Street totaled approximately $40 billion in 2012,[329] while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as $324,000 annually.[330] In fiscal year 2013\u201314, Wall Street's securities industry generated 19% of New York State's tax revenue.[331] New York City remains the largest global center for trading in public equity and debt capital markets, driven in part by the size and financial development of the U.S. economy.[332]:31\u201332[333] In July 2013, NYSE Euronext, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, took over the administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association.[334] New York also leads in hedge fund management; private equity; and the monetary volume of mergers and acquisitions. Several investment banks and investment managers headquartered in Manhattan are important participants in other global financial centers.[332]:34\u201335 New York is also the principal commercial banking center of the United States.[335] Many of the world's largest media conglomerates are also based in the city. Manhattan contained over 500 million square feet (46.5 million m2) of office space in 2015,[336] making it the largest office market in the United States,[337] while Midtown Manhattan, with nearly 400 million square feet (37.2 million m2) in 2015,[336] is the largest central business district in the world.[338] Silicon Alley, centered in Manhattan, has evolved into a metonym for the sphere encompassing the New York City metropolitan region's high technology industries[340] involving the Internet, new media, telecommunications, digital media, software development, biotechnology, game design, financial technology (\"FinTech\"), and other fields within information technology that are supported by its entrepreneurship ecosystem and venture capital investments. In 2015, Silicon Alley generated over US$7.3 billion in venture capital investment across a broad spectrum of high technology enterprises,[48] most based in Manhattan, with others in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology startup companies and employment are growing in New York City and the region, bolstered by the city's position in North America as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines,[341] New York's intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity.[342] Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City.[343] As of 2014[update], New York City hosted 300,000 employees in the tech sector.[344][345] The biotechnology sector is also growing in New York City, based upon the city's strength in academic scientific research and public and commercial financial support. On December 19, 2011, then Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced his choice of Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to build a US$2 billion graduate school of applied sciences called Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island with the goal of transforming New York City into the world's premier technology capital.[346][347] By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, had raised more than US$30\u00a0million from investors, including Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, for initial funding to create biotechnology startups at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which encompasses more than 700,000 square feet (65,000\u00a0m2) on East 29th Street and promotes collaboration among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, medical, and research institutions. The New York City Economic Development Corporation's Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture capital partners, including Celgene, General Electric Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed a minimum of US$100\u00a0million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures in life sciences and biotechnology.[348] Tourism is a vital industry for New York City, which has witnessed a growing combined volume of international and domestic tourists, receiving a seventh consecutive annual record of approximately 61 million visitors in 2016.[53] Tourism had generated an all-time high US$61.3 billion in overall economic impact for New York City in 2014,[53] pending 2015 statistics. Approximately 12 million visitors to New York City were from outside the United States, with the highest numbers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, and China. In 2016, New York City tourism attained a record high for the sixth year in a row.[53] I Love New York (stylized I \u2764 NY) is both a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign and have been used since 1977 to promote tourism in New York City,[349] and later to promote New York State as well. The trademarked logo, owned by New York State Empire State Development,[350] appears in souvenir shops and brochures throughout the city and state, some licensed, many not.

The New York Wheel, a 630-foot ferris wheel, was under construction at the northern shore of Staten Island in 2015,[352] overlooking the Statue of Liberty, New York Harbor, and the Lower Manhattan skyline.[353] Manhattan was on track to have an estimated 90,000 hotel rooms at the end of 2014, a 10% increase from 2013.[354] In October 2014, the Anbang Insurance Group, based in China, purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the world's most expensive hotel ever sold.[355] New York is a prominent location for the American entertainment industry, with many films, television series, books, and other media being set there.[356] As of 2012[update], New York City was the second largest center for filmmaking and television production in the United States, producing about 200 feature films annually, employing 130,000 individuals; the filmed entertainment industry has been growing in New York, contributing nearly US$9 billion to the New York City economy alone as of 2015,[357] and by volume, New York is the world leader in independent film production[358] \u2013 one-third of all American independent films are produced in New York City.[359] The Association of Independent Commercial Producers is also based in New York.[360] In the first five months of 2014 alone, location filming for television pilots in New York City exceeded the record production levels for all of 2013,[361] with New York surpassing Los Angeles as the top North American city for the same distinction during the 2013/2014 cycle.[362] New York City is additionally a center for the advertising, music, newspaper, digital media, and publishing industries and is also the largest media market in North America.[363] Some of the city's media conglomerates and institutions include Time Warner, the Thomson Reuters Corporation, the Associated Press, Bloomberg L.P., the News Corporation, The New York Times Company, NBCUniversal, the Hearst Corporation, AOL, and Viacom. Seven of the world's top eight global advertising agency networks have their headquarters in New York.[364] Two of the top three record labels' headquarters are in New York: Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group. Universal Music Group also has offices in New York. New media enterprises are contributing an increasingly important component to the city's central role in the media sphere. More than 200 newspapers and 350 consumer magazines have an office in the city,[359] and the publishing industry employs about 25,000 people.[365] Two of the three national daily newspapers in the United States are New York papers: The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, which has won the most Pulitzer Prizes for journalism. Major tabloid newspapers in the city include: The New York Daily News, which was founded in 1919 by Joseph Medill Patterson[366] and The New York Post, founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton.[367] The city also has a comprehensive ethnic press, with 270 newspapers and magazines published in more than 40 languages.[368] El Diario La Prensa is New York's largest Spanish-language daily and the oldest in the nation.[369] The New York Amsterdam News, published in Harlem, is a prominent African American newspaper. The Village Voice, historically the largest alternative newspaper in the United States, announced in 2017 that it would cease publication of its print edition and convert to a fully digital venture.[370] The television and radio industry developed in New York and is a significant employer in the city's economy. The three major American broadcast networks are all headquartered in New York: ABC, CBS, and NBC. Many cable networks are based in the city as well, including MTV, Fox News, HBO, Showtime, Bravo, Food Network, AMC, and Comedy Central. The City of New York operates a public broadcast service, NYCTV,[371] that has produced several original Emmy Award-winning shows covering music and culture in city neighborhoods and city government. WBAI, with news and information programming, is one of the few socialist radio stations operating in the United States. New York is also a major center for non-commercial educational media. The oldest public-access television channel in the United States is the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, founded in 1971.[372] WNET is the city's major public television station and a primary source of national Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television programming. WNYC, a public radio station owned by the city until 1997, has the largest public radio audience in the United States.[373] The New York City Public Schools system, managed by the New York City Department of Education, is the largest public school system in the United States, serving about 1.1\u00a0million students in more than 1,700 separate primary and secondary schools.[374] The city's public school system includes nine specialized high schools to serve academically and artistically gifted students. The city government pays the Pelham Public Schools to educate a very small, detached section of the Bronx.[375] The New York City Charter School Center assists the setup of new charter schools.[377] There are approximately 900 additional privately run secular and religious schools in the city.[378] Over 600,000 students are enrolled in New York City's over 120 higher education institutions, the highest number of any city in the United States, including over half million in the City University of New York (CUNY) system alone in 2014.[379] In 2005, three out of five Manhattan residents were college graduates, and one out of four had a postgraduate degree, forming one of the highest concentrations of highly educated people in any American city.[380] New York City is home to such notable private universities as Barnard College, Columbia University, Cooper Union, Fordham University, Mercy College, New York University, New York Institute of Technology, Pace University, Rockefeller University, and Yeshiva University; several of these universities are ranked among the top universities in the world.[79][80] The public CUNY system is one of the largest universities in the nation, comprising 24 institutions across all five boroughs: senior colleges, community colleges, and other graduate/professional schools. The public State University of New York (SUNY) system serves New York City, as well as the rest of the state. The city also has other smaller private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions, such as St. John's University, The Juilliard School, Manhattan College, The College of Mount Saint Vincent, Fashion Institute of Technology, Parsons School of Design, The New School, Pratt Institute, The School of Visual Arts, The King's College, and Wagner College. Much of the scientific research in the city is done in medicine and the life sciences. New York City has the most post-graduate life sciences degrees awarded annually in the United States, with 127 Nobel laureates having roots in local institutions as of 2005[update];[381] while in 2012, 43,523 licensed physicians were practicing in New York City.[382] Major biomedical research institutions include Memorial Sloan\u2013Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and Weill Cornell Medical College, being joined by the Cornell University/Technion-Israel Institute of Technology venture on Roosevelt Island. The graduates of SUNY Maritime College in the Bronx earned the highest average annual salary of any university graduates in the United States, US$144,000 as of 2017.[383] The New York Public Library, which has the largest collection of any public library system in the United States, serves Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island.[384] Queens is served by the Queens Borough Public Library, the nation's second largest public library system, while the Brooklyn Public Library serves Brooklyn.[384] The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) operates the public hospitals and clinics in New York City. A public benefit corporation with $6.7 billion in annual revenues, HHC is the largest municipal healthcare system in the United States serving 1.4 million patients, including more than 475,000 uninsured city residents.[386] HHC was created in 1969 by the New York State Legislature as a public benefit corporation (Chapter 1016 of the Laws 1969).[387] HHC operates 11 acute care hospitals, five nursing homes, six diagnostic and treatment centers, and more than 70 community-based primary care sites, serving primarily the poor and working class. HHC's MetroPlus Health Plan is one of the New York area's largest providers of government-sponsored health insurance and is the plan of choice for nearly half million New Yorkers.[388] HHC's facilities annually provide millions of New Yorkers services interpreted in more than 190 languages.[389] The most well-known hospital in the HHC system is Bellevue Hospital, the oldest public hospital in the United States. Bellevue is the designated hospital for treatment of the President of the United States and other world leaders if they become sick or injured while in New York City.[390] The president of HHC is Ramanathan Raju, MD, a surgeon and former CEO of the Cook County health system in Illinois.[391] In August 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio signed legislation outlawing pharmacies from selling cigarettes once their existing licenses to do so expired, beginning in 2018.[392] The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has been the largest police force in the United States by a significant margin, with over 35,000 sworn officers.[393] Members of the NYPD are frequently referred to by politicians, the media, and their own police cars by the nickname, New York's Finest. Crime has continued an overall downward trend in New York City since the 1990s.[394] In 2012, the NYPD came under scrutiny for its use of a stop-and-frisk program,[395][396][397] which has undergone several policy revisions since then. In 2014, New York City had the third lowest murder rate among the largest U.S. cities,[398] having become significantly safer after a spike in crime in the 1970s through 1990s.[399] Violent crime in New York City decreased more than 75% from 1993 to 2005, and continued decreasing during periods when the nation as a whole saw increases.[400] By 2002, New York City's crime rate was similar to that of Provo, Utah, and was ranked 197th in crime among the 216 U.S. cities with populations greater than 100,000.[400] In 2005, the homicide rate was at its lowest level since 1966,[401] and in 2007, the city recorded fewer than 500 homicides for the first time ever since crime statistics were first published in 1963.[402] In 2015, 50.5% of New York City misdemeanor assault suspects were black, 33.3% Hispanic, 11.1% white, 4.8% Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.3% Native American.[403] New York City experienced 352 homicides in 2015,[404] its second lowest number on record.[405] Sociologists and criminologists have not reached consensus on the explanation for the dramatic decrease in the city's crime rate. Some attribute the phenomenon to new tactics used by the NYPD,[406] including its use of CompStat and the broken windows theory.[407] Others cite the end of the crack epidemic and demographic changes,[408] including from immigration.[409] Another theory is that widespread exposure to lead pollution from automobile exhaust, which can lower intelligence and increase aggression levels, incited the initial crime wave in the mid-20th century, most acutely affecting heavily trafficked cities like New York. A strong correlation was found demonstrating that violent crime rates in New York and other big cities began to fall after lead was removed from American gasoline in the 1970s.[410] Another theory cited to explain New York City's falling homicide rate is the inverse correlation between the number of murders and the increasingly wetter climate in the city.[411] Organized crime has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points in the 1820s. The 20th century saw a rise in the Mafia, dominated by the Five Families, as well as in gangs, including the Black Spades.[412] The Mafia and gang presence has declined in the city in the 21st century.[413][414] The New York City Fire Department (FDNY), provides fire protection, technical rescue, primary response to biological, chemical, and radioactive hazards, and emergency medical services for the five boroughs of New York City. The New York City Fire Department is the largest municipal fire department in the United States and the second largest in the world after the Tokyo Fire Department. The FDNY employs approximately 11,080 uniformed firefighters and over 3,300 uniformed EMTs and paramedics. The FDNY's motto is New York's Bravest. The New York City Fire Department faces highly multifaceted firefighting challenges in many ways unique to New York. In addition to responding to building types that range from wood-frame single family homes to high-rise structures, there are many secluded bridges and tunnels, as well as large parks and wooded areas that can give rise to brush fires. New York is also home to one of the largest subway systems in the world, consisting of hundreds of miles of tunnel with electrified track. The FDNY headquarters is located at 9 MetroTech Center in Downtown Brooklyn,[415] and the FDNY Fire Academy is located on Randalls Island.[416] There are three Bureau of Fire Communications alarm offices which receive and dispatch alarms to appropriate units. One office, at 11 Metrotech Center in Brooklyn, houses Manhattan/Citywide, Brooklyn, and Staten Island Fire Communications. The Bronx and Queens offices are in separate buildings. New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world by the diplomatic consulates of Iceland[18] and Latvia[19] and by New York's Baruch College.[20] A book containing a series of essays titled New York, Culture Capital of the World, 1940\u20131965 has also been published as showcased by the National Library of Australia.[21] In describing New York, author Tom Wolfe said, \"Culture just seems to be in the air, like part of the weather.\"[417] Numerous major American cultural movements began in the city, such as the Harlem Renaissance, which established the African-American literary canon in the United States.[418][419] The city was a center of jazz[420] in the 1940s, abstract expressionism in the 1950s, and the birthplace of hip hop in the 1970s.[421] The city's punk[422] and hardcore[423] scenes were influential in the 1970s and 1980s. New York has long had a flourishing scene for Jewish American literature. The city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract expressionism (also known as the New York School) in painting; and hip hop,[193] punk, salsa, disco, freestyle, Tin Pan Alley, and jazz in music. New York City has been considered the dance capital of the world.[424][425][426] The city is also frequently the setting for novels, movies (see List of films set in New York City), and television programs. New York Fashion Week is one of the world's preeminent fashion events and is afforded extensive coverage by the media.[427][428] New York has also frequently been ranked the top fashion capital of the world on the annual list compiled by the Global Language Monitor.[429] New York City has more than 2,000 arts and cultural organizations and more than 500 art galleries of all sizes.[430] The city government funds the arts with a larger annual budget than the National Endowment for the Arts.[430] Wealthy business magnates in the 19th century built a network of major cultural institutions, such as the famed Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, that would become internationally established. The advent of electric lighting led to elaborate theater productions, and in the 1880s, New York City theaters on Broadway and along 42nd Street began featuring a new stage form that became known as the Broadway musical. Strongly influenced by the city's immigrants, productions such as those of Harrigan and Hart, George M. Cohan, and others used song in narratives that often reflected themes of hope and ambition. New York City itself is the subject or background of many plays and musicals. Broadway theatre is one of the premier forms of English-language theatre in the world, named after Broadway, the major thoroughfare that crosses Times Square,[431] also sometimes referred to as \"The Great White Way\".[432][433][434] Forty-one venues in Midtown Manhattan's Theatre District, each with at least 500 seats, are classified as Broadway theatres. According to The Broadway League, Broadway shows sold approximately US$1.27 billion worth of tickets in the 2013\u20132014 season, an 11.4% increase from US$1.139 billion in the 2012\u20132013 season. Attendance in 2013\u20132014 stood at 12.21 million, representing a 5.5% increase from the 2012\u20132013 season's 11.57 million.[435] Performance artists displaying diverse skills are ubiquitous on the streets of Manhattan. Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, anchoring Lincoln Square on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is home to numerous influential arts organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Opera, New York Philharmonic, and New York City Ballet, as well as the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the Juilliard School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and Alice Tully Hall. The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute is in Union Square, and Tisch School of the Arts is based at New York University, while Central Park SummerStage presents free music concerts in Central Park.[436] New York City is home to hundreds of cultural institutions and historic sites, many of which are internationally known. Museum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 105th streets on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,[438] in an area sometimes called Upper Carnegie Hill.[439] The Mile, which contains one of the densest displays of culture in the world, is actually three blocks longer than one mile (1.6\u00a0km). Ten museums occupy the length of this section of Fifth Avenue.[440] The tenth museum, the Museum for African Art, joined the ensemble in 2009, although its museum at 110th Street, the first new museum constructed on the Mile since the Guggenheim in 1959,[441] opened in late 2012. In addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum Mile Festival, held each year in June, to promote the museums and increase visitation.[442] Many of the world's most lucrative art auctions are held in New York City. New York City's food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. Central European and Italian immigrants brought bagels, cheesecake, and New York-style pizza into the city, while Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses have become ubiquitous. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs[444] examples of modern New York street food. The city is home to \"nearly one thousand of the finest and most diverse haute cuisine restaurants in the world\", according to Michelin.[445] The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene assigns letter grades to the city's 24,000 restaurants based upon their inspection results.[446] New York City is well known for its street parades, which celebrate a broad array of themes, including holidays, nationalities, human rights, and major league sports team championship victories. The majority of parades are held in Manhattan. The primary orientation of the annual street parades is typically from north to south, marching along major avenues. The annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is the world's largest parade,[447] beginning alongside Central Park and processing southward to the flagship Macy's Herald Square store;[448] the parade is viewed on telecasts worldwide and draws millions of spectators in person.[447] Other notable parades including the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade in March, the LGBT Pride March in June, the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in October, and numerous parades commemorating the independence days of many nations. Ticker-tape parades celebrating championships won by sports teams as well as other heroic accomplishments march northward along the Canyon of Heroes on Broadway from Bowling Green to City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan. The New York area has historically been home to a distinctive regional speech pattern called the New York dialect, alternatively known as Brooklynese or New Yorkese. It has generally been considered one of the most recognizable accents within American English.[449] The classic version of this dialect is centered on middle and working-class people of European descent. The influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect,[450] and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general New Yorkers as in the past.[450] The traditional New York area accent is characterized as non-rhotic, so that the sound [\u0279] does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant; hence the pronunciation of the city name as \"New Yawk.\"[450] There is no [\u0279] in words like park [p\u0251\u0259k] or [p\u0252\u0259k] (with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low-back chain shift), butter [b\u028c\u027e\u0259], or here [hi\u0259]. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the [\u0254] vowel sound of words like talk, law, cross, chocolate, and coffee and the often homophonous [\u0254r] in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in General American. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like \"girl\" and of words like \"oil\" became a diphthong [\u025c\u026a]. This would often be misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds, so that girl is pronounced \"goil\" and oil is pronounced \"erl\"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like \"Joizey\" (Jersey), \"Toidy-Toid Street\" (33rd St.) and \"terlet\" (toilet).[450] The character Archie Bunker from the 1970s sitcom All in the Family (played by Carroll O'Connor) was an example of having used this pattern of speech, which continues to fade in its overall presence. New York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League,[452] Major League Baseball,[453] the National Basketball Association,[454] the National Hockey League,[455] and Major League Soccer.[456] The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in these five professional leagues. Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues, and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1882. The city has played host to over forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues, both current and historic. Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide (MetLife Stadium, the new Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, and Citi Field) are located in the New York metropolitan area.[457] Madison Square Garden, its predecessor, the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field, are sporting venues located in New York City, the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps. New York has been described as the \"Capital of Baseball\".[458] There have been 35 Major League Baseball World Series and 73 pennants won by New York teams. It is one of only five metro areas (Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore\u2013Washington, and the San Francisco Bay Area being the others) to have two baseball teams. Additionally, there have been 14 World Series in which two New York City teams played each other, known as a Subway Series and occurring most recently in 2000. No other metropolitan area has had this happen more than once (Chicago in 1906, St. Louis in 1944, and the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989). The city's two current Major League Baseball teams are the New York Mets, who play at Citi Field in Queens,[459] and the New York Yankees, who play at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.[460] who compete in six games of interleague play every regular season that has also come to be called the Subway Series. The Yankees have won a record 27 championships,[461] while the Mets have won the World Series twice.[462] The city also was once home to the Brooklyn Dodgers (now the Los Angeles Dodgers), who won the World Series once,[463] and the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants), who won the World Series five times. Both teams moved to California in 1958.[464] There are also two Minor League Baseball teams in the city, the Brooklyn Cyclones[465] and Staten Island Yankees.[466] The city is represented in the National Football League by the New York Giants and the New York Jets, although both teams play their home games at MetLife Stadium in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey,[467] which hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014.[468] The New York Islanders[469] and the New York Rangers[470] represent the city in the National Hockey League. Also within the metropolitan area are the New Jersey Devils, who play in nearby Newark, New Jersey.[471] The city's National Basketball Association teams are the Brooklyn Nets and the New York Knicks, while the New York Liberty is the city's Women's National Basketball Association. The first national college-level basketball championship, the National Invitation Tournament, was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city.[472] The city is well known for its links to basketball, which is played in nearly every park in the city by local youth, many of whom have gone on to play for major college programs and in the NBA. In soccer, New York City is represented by New York City FC of Major League Soccer, who play their home games at Yankee Stadium.[473] The New York Red Bulls play their home games at Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison, New Jersey.[474] Historically, the city is known for the New York Cosmos, the highly successful former professional soccer team which was the American home of Pel\u00e9. A new version of the New York Cosmos was formed in 2010, and began play in the second division North American Soccer League in 2013. The Cosmos play their home games at James M. Shuart Stadium on the campus of Hofstra University, just outside the New York City limits in Hempstead, New York. The annual United States Open Tennis Championships is one of the world's four Grand Slam tennis tournaments and is held at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens.[475] The New York City Marathon, which courses through all five boroughs, is the world's largest running marathon,[451] with 51,394 finishers in 2016[476] and 98,247 applicants for the 2017 race.[451] The Millrose Games is an annual track and field meet whose featured event is the Wanamaker Mile. Boxing is also a prominent part of the city's sporting scene, with events like the Amateur Boxing Golden Gloves being held at Madison Square Garden each year.[477] The city is also considered the host of the Belmont Stakes, the last, longest and oldest of horse racing's Triple Crown races, held just over the city's border at Belmont Park on the first or second Sunday of June. The city also hosted the 1932 U.S. Open golf tournament and the 1930 and 1939 PGA Championships, and has been host city for both events several times, most notably for nearby Winged Foot Golf Club. The Gaelic games are played in Riverdale, Bronx at Gaelic Park, home to the New York GAA, the only North American team to compete at the senior inter-county level. New York City's comprehensive transportation system is both complex and extensive. Mass transit in New York City, most of which runs 24 hours a day, accounts for one in every three users of mass transit in the United States, and two-thirds of the nation's rail riders live in the New York City Metropolitan Area.[478][479] The iconic New York City Subway system is the largest rapid transit system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with 472, and by length of routes. Nearly all of New York's subway system is open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, including Hong Kong,[480][481] London, Paris, Seoul,[482][483] and Tokyo. The New York City Subway is also the busiest metropolitan rail transit system in the Western Hemisphere, with 1.76 billion passenger rides in 2015,[484] while Grand Central Terminal, also referred to as \"Grand Central Station\", is the world's largest railway station by number of train platforms. Public transport is essential in New York City. 54.6% of New Yorkers commuted to work in 2005 using mass transit.[485] This is in contrast to the rest of the United States, where about 90% of commuters drive automobiles to their workplace.[486] According to the New York City Comptroller, workers in the New York City area spend an average of 6 hours and 18 minutes getting to work each week, the longest commute time in the nation among large cities.[487] New York is the only US city in which a majority (52%) of households do not have a car; only 22% of Manhattanites own a car.[488] Due to their high usage of mass transit, New Yorkers spend less of their household income on transportation than the national average, saving $19 billion annually on transportation compared to other urban Americans.[489] New York City's commuter rail network is the largest in North America.[478] The rail network, connecting New York City to its suburbs, consists of the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, and New Jersey Transit. The combined systems converge at Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station and contain more than 250 stations and 20 rail lines.[478] In Queens, the elevated AirTrain people mover system connects JFK International Airport to the New York City Subway and the Long Island Rail Road; a separate AirTrain system is planned alongside the Grand Central Parkway to connect LaGuardia Airport to these transit systems.[490][491] For intercity rail, New York City is served by Amtrak, whose busiest station by a significant margin is Pennsylvania Station on the West Side of Manhattan, from which Amtrak provides connections to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. along the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance train service to other North American cities.[492] The Staten Island Railway rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island, operating 24 hours a day. The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to northeastern New Jersey, primarily Hoboken, Jersey City, and Newark. Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day; meaning three of the six rapid transit systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York (the others are a portion of the Chicago 'L', the PATCO Speedline serving Philadelphia, and the Copenhagen Metro). Multibillion-dollar heavy rail transit projects under construction in New York City include the Second Avenue Subway, the East Side Access project, and the 7 Subway Extension.[493] New York City's public bus fleet is the largest in North America,[495] and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the main intercity bus terminal of the city, serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily, making it the busiest bus station in the world.[494] New York's airspace is the busiest in the United States and one of the world's busiest air transportation corridors. The three busiest airports in the New York metropolitan area include John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport; 130.5 million travelers used these three airports in 2016, and the city's airspace is the busiest in the nation.[496] JFK and Newark Liberty were the busiest and fourth busiest U.S. gateways for international air passengers, respectively, in 2012; as of 2011[update], JFK was the busiest airport for international passengers in North America.[497] Plans have advanced to expand passenger volume at a fourth airport, Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, New York, by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.[498] Plans were announced in July 2015 to entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport in a multibillion-dollar project to replace its aging facilities.[499] Other commercial airports in or serving the New York metropolitan area include Long Island MacArthur Airport, Trenton\u2013Mercer Airport and Westchester County Airport. The primary general aviation airport serving the area is Teterboro Airport. The Staten Island Ferry is the world's busiest ferry route, carrying over 23 million passengers from July 2015 through June 2016 on the 5.2-mile (8.4\u00a0km) route between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan and running 24 hours a day.[500] Other ferry systems shuttle commuters between Manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan area. NYC Ferry, a NYCEDC initiative with routes planned to travel to all five boroughs, was launched in 2017, with second graders choosing the names of the ferries.[501] Meanwhile, Seastreak ferry announced construction of a 600-passenger high-speed luxury ferry in September 2016, to shuttle riders between the Jersey Shore and Manhattan, anticipated to start service in 2017; this would be the largest vessel in its class.[502] Other features of the city's transportation infrastructure encompass more than 12,000 yellow taxicabs;[503] various competing startup transportation network companies; and an aerial tramway that transports commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan Island. Ride-sharing services have become significant competition for cab drivers in New York.[504][505] Despite New York's heavy reliance on its vast public transit system, streets are a defining feature of the city. Manhattan's street grid plan greatly influenced the city's physical development. Several of the city's streets and avenues, like Broadway,[506] Wall Street,[507] Madison Avenue,[322][508] and Seventh Avenue are also used as metonyms for national industries there: the theater, finance, advertising, and fashion organizations, respectively. New York City also has an extensive web of expressways and parkways, which link the city's boroughs to each other and to northern New Jersey, Westchester County, Long Island, and southwestern Connecticut through various bridges and tunnels. Because these highways serve millions of outer borough and suburban residents who commute into Manhattan, it is quite common for motorists to be stranded for hours in traffic jams that are a daily occurrence, particularly during rush hour.[509] New York City is located on one of the world's largest natural harbors,[514] and the boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are (primarily) coterminous with islands of the same names, while Queens and Brooklyn are located at the west end of the larger Long Island, and The Bronx is located at the southern tip of New York State's mainland. This situation of boroughs separated by water led to the development of an extensive infrastructure of well-known bridges and tunnels. The George Washington Bridge is the world's busiest motor vehicle bridge,[515][516] connecting Manhattan to Bergen County, New Jersey. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the Americas and one of the world's longest.[510][511] The Brooklyn Bridge is an icon of the city itself. The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone, granite, and Rosendale cement, and their architectural style is neo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and is the first steel-wire suspension bridge. The Queensboro Bridge is an important piece of cantilever architecture. The Manhattan Bridge, opened in 1909, is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges, and its design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges around the world; the Manhattan Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge are all examples of Structural Expressionism.[517][518] Manhattan Island is linked to New York City's outer boroughs and New Jersey by several tunnels as well. The Lincoln Tunnel, which carries 120,000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan, is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world.[519] The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sailed through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan's piers. The Holland Tunnel, connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City, New Jersey, was the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927.[520][521] The Queens-Midtown Tunnel, built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn, was the largest non-federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940.[522] President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through it.[523] The Hugh L. Carey Tunnel runs underneath Battery Park and connects the Financial District at the southern tip of Manhattan to Red Hook in Brooklyn. New York City has focused on reducing its environmental impact and carbon footprint.[524] Mass transit use in New York City is the highest in the United States. Also, by 2010, the city had 3,715 hybrid taxis and other clean diesel vehicles, representing around 28% of New York's taxi fleet in service, the most of any city in North America.[525] New York's high rate of public transit use, over 200,000 daily cyclists as of 2014[update],[526] and many pedestrian commuters make it the most energy-efficient major city in the United States.[527] Walk and bicycle modes of travel account for 21% of all modes for trips in the city; nationally the rate for metro regions is about 8%.[528] In both its 2011 and 2015 rankings, Walk Score named New York City the most walkable large city in the United States.[529][530][531] Citibank sponsored the introduction of 10,000 public bicycles for the city's bike-share project in the summer of 2013.[532] Research conducted by Quinnipiac University showed that a majority of New Yorkers support the initiative.[533] New York City's numerical \"in-season cycling indicator\" of bicycling in the city hit an all-time high in 2013.[534] The city government was a petitioner in the landmark Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency Supreme Court case forcing the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. The city is a leader in the construction of energy-efficient green office buildings, including the Hearst Tower among others.[167] Mayor Bill de Blasio has committed to an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions between 2014 and 2050 to reduce the city's contributions to climate change, beginning with a comprehensive \"Green Buildings\" plan.[524] New York City is supplied with drinking water by the protected Catskill Mountains watershed.[535] As a result of the watershed's integrity and undisturbed natural water filtration system, New York is one of only four major cities in the United States the majority of whose drinking water is pure enough not to require purification by water treatment plants.[536] The Croton Watershed north of the city is undergoing construction of a US$3.2 billion water purification plant to augment New York City's water supply by an estimated 290 million gallons daily, representing a greater than 20% addition to the city's current availability of water.[537] The ongoing expansion of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, an integral part of the New York City water supply system, is the largest capital construction project in the city's history,[538] with segments serving Manhattan and The Bronx completed, and with segments serving Brooklyn and Queens planned for construction in 2020.[539] Newtown Creek, a 3.5-mile (6-kilometer) a long estuary that forms part of the border between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, has been designated a Superfund site for environmental clean-up and remediation of the waterway's recreational and economic resources for many communities.[540] One of the most heavily used bodies of water in the Port of New York and New Jersey, it had been one of the most contaminated industrial sites in the country,[541] containing years of discarded toxins, an estimated 30\u00a0million US gallons (110,000\u00a0m3) of spilled oil, including the Greenpoint oil spill, raw sewage from New York City's sewer system,[541] and other accumulation. New York City has been a metropolitan municipality with a mayor\u2013council form of government[542] since its consolidation in 1898. In New York City, the city government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. The Mayor and council members are elected to four-year terms. The City Council is a unicameral body consisting of 51 council members whose districts are defined by geographic population boundaries.[543] Each term for the mayor and council members lasts four years and has a three consecutive-term limit,[544] which is reset after a four-year break. The New York City Administrative Code, the New York City Rules, and the City Record are the code of local laws, compilation of regulations, and official journal, respectively.[545][546] Each borough is coextensive with a judicial district of the state Unified Court System, of which the Criminal Court and the Civil Court are the local courts, while the New York Supreme Court conducts major trials and appeals. Manhattan hosts the First Department of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division while Brooklyn hosts the Second Department. There are also several extrajudicial administrative courts, which are executive agencies and not part of the state Unified Court System. Uniquely among major American cities, New York is divided between, and is host to the main branches of, two different US district courts: the District Court for the Southern District of New York, whose main courthouse is on Foley Square near City Hall in Manhattan and whose jurisdiction includes Manhattan and the Bronx; and the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, whose main courthouse is in Brooklyn and whose jurisdiction includes Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and US Court of International Trade are also based in New York, also on Foley Square in Manhattan. The present mayor is Bill de Blasio, the first Democrat since 1993.[547] He was elected in 2013 with over 73% of the vote, and assumed office on January 1, 2014. The Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices. As of April 2016, 69% of registered voters in the city are Democrats and 10% are Republicans.[548] New York City has not been carried by a Republican in a statewide or presidential election since President Calvin Coolidge won the five boroughs in 1924. In 2012, Democrat Barack Obama became the first presidential candidate of any party to receive more than 80% of the overall vote in New York City, sweeping all five boroughs. Party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city. New York is the most important source of political fundraising in the United States, as four of the top five ZIP codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top ZIP code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John Kerry.[549] The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends $11.4\u00a0billion more than it receives back). City residents and businesses also spent an additional $4.1\u00a0billion in the 2009\u20132010 fiscal year to the state of New York than the city received in return.[550] In 2006, the Sister City Program of the City of New York, Inc. was restructured and renamed New York City Global Partners. Through this program, New York City has expanded its international outreach to a network of cities worldwide, promoting the exchange of ideas and innovation between their citizenry and policymakers. New York's historic sister cities are denoted below by the year they joined New York City's partnership network.[551] Asia (East) (South) (West) Australia Europe (Central) (East) (North) (South) (West) North America (Canada) (Mexico, Central America, and Caribbean) (United States) South America",

I very much enjoyed the museum and grateful that there isn\u2019t a charge for the under 16\u2019s, as my 15 year old son has a different opinion. I would however recommend better signage. For instance, the main desk, where people were queuing (presumably for tickets) turns out to be for something else and were directed to another area. Fortunately I could use the self service machine which made up for the wasted earlier queuing. You also have a policy of not allowing backpacks into the galleries which is fine, again make this clear before queuing again. And not allowing backpacks but allowing other bags the size of small cars is beyond me, but who am I. Fortunately I only had to queue for another 10 minutes to off load my back pack and coat to the \u201ccheerful\u201d attendant. On collection I only had to queue for another 10 minutes together with a host of people also queuing for no apparent reason. This was until one of your staff intervened and pointed these people elsewhere. Again better signage would sort this out. I notice your plans to extend the museum and hope you can add a few minor improvements with signage to your plans. I wish you well for the future.

When it was over the crowd immediately jumped to their feet for a standing ovation! I so looked forward to applauding each actor who did a fantastic job. Unfortunately, our applause was cut short by fundraising. I was so mad. Now, I am not saying that the fundraising isn\u2019t for a good cause. That wasn\u2019t it at all.

            "content": "Advertisement By MATT APUZZO, ADAM GOLDMAN, MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and MATTHEW ROSENBERGOCT. 30, 2017 President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has been charged with tax fraud and money laundering. But this isn\u2019t Mr. Manafort\u2019s first public scandal. WASHINGTON \u2014 The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, announced charges on Monday against three advisers to President Trump\u2019s campaign and laid out the most explicit evidence to date that his campaign was eager to coordinate with the Russian government to damage his rival, Hillary Clinton. The former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, surrendered to the F.B.I. and pleaded not guilty to charges that he laundered millions of dollars through overseas shell companies \u2014 using the money to buy luxury cars, real estate, antique rugs and expensive clothes. Rick Gates, Mr. Manafort\u2019s longtime associate as well as a campaign adviser, was also charged and turned himself in. But information that could prove most politically damaging to Mr. Trump came an hour later, when Mr. Mueller announced that George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, had pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and was cooperating with investigators. In court documents released on Monday, federal investigators said they suspected that Russian intelligence services had used intermediaries to contact Mr. Papadopoulos to gain influence with the campaign, offering \u201cdirt\u201d on Mrs. Clinton in April 2016 in the form of \u201cthousands of emails.\u201d Mr. Papadopoulos secretly pleaded guilty weeks ago to lying to the F.B.I. about those contacts and has been cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors for months. The New York Times journalists Mark Mazzetti, Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman analyze the indictments of Paul Manafort and Richard Gates, and the cooperation of George Papadopoulos with the investigation of Robert S. Mueller III. Monday\u2019s dramatic announcements capped months of speculation about which of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign advisers might be first to be charged by Mr. Mueller, and they seemed to be a sign that the special counsel\u2019s investigation is nowhere close to complete. Advertisement \u201cThere\u2019s a large-scale, ongoing investigation of which this case is a small part,\u201d Aaron S.J. Zelinsky, a prosecutor on Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, said at Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s plea hearing this month. The transcript of the hearing was released on Monday. Advertisement It is now clear, from Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s admission and emails related to a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016, that the Russian government offered help to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy and campaign officials were willing to take it. The United States has concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried to tip the outcome of the 2016 election in favor of Mr. Trump. As part of that effort, Russian operatives hacked Democratic accounts and released a trove of embarrassing emails related to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Mueller and his team are investigating whether anyone close to Mr. Trump participated in that effort.                 Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, was indicted on charges including conspiracy, money laundering and other charges. Mr. Manafort's business associate, Rick Gates, was also charged.             The announcements rippled across Washington, affecting both political parties. The powerful Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta quit his lobbying firm Monday. The firm, the Podesta Group, was hired to do lobbying work on behalf of Ukraine, work that is at the heart of Mr. Manafort\u2019s indictment. The tax and money laundering case against Mr. Manafort describes a complicated scheme in which he lobbied for a pro-Russia party in Ukraine and its leader, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and hid proceeds in bank accounts in Cyprus, the Grenadines and elsewhere. Prosecutors say he laundered more than $18 million, and spent the money extravagantly. A home improvement company in the Hamptons was paid nearly $5.5 million, according to the indictment. More than $1.3 million more went to clothing stores in New York and Beverly Hills, Calif. Mr. Manafort bought a $3 million brownstone in Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn and a $2.8 million condominium in SoHo, prosecutors said. \u201cManafort used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States without paying taxes on that income,\u201d the indictment reads. He was also charged with failing to register as a foreign lobbyist. The charges carry the potential for roughly 20 years in prison, putting pressure on Mr. Manafort to provide information on others in exchange for leniency. Among other things, Mr. Manafort could shed light on how widely in the campaign it was known that Russia had damaging information on Mrs. Clinton. A senior White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, said last week that the president was confident that Mr. Manafort had no damaging information about him.                 President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman is charged with channeling large sums of money from offshore bank accounts to pay for goods, services and real estate in the United States.             In a court appearance on Monday, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates pleaded not guilty and were placed under house arrest on multimillion-dollar bonds. Mr. Papadopoulos is awaiting sentencing. Advertisement Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyer, Kevin Downing, called the money laundering charges \u201cridiculous\u201d and noted that in the past half-century, prosecutors have charged only a handful of people with flouting foreign lobbying rules. Such violations are normally handled as an administrative matter. Mr. Manafort\u2019s Ukraine lobbying \u201cended in 2014, two years before Mr. Manafort served in the Trump campaign,\u201d Mr. Downing said. Lawyers for Mr. Papadopoulos declined to comment. While the indictment paints an unflattering picture of the man Mr. Trump tapped to run his campaign, the allegations long predate his involvement in the presidential race. Mr. Trump seized on that fact, declaring on Twitter that \u201cthere is NO COLLUSION!\u201d But as Mr. Trump typed out that message, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team was unsealing documents related to Mr. Papadopoulos that directly undermined the president\u2019s claim. Mr. Trump called Mr. Papadopoulos an \u201cexcellent guy\u201d when he announced his foreign policy team in March 2016. On Monday, however, White House officials described him as someone who played an insignificant role in the campaign. \u201cLook, this individual was a member of a volunteer advisory council that met one time over the course of a year,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. \u201cI\u2019m not here to speak on behalf of the thousands of people that may have volunteered on the campaign.\u201d In March 2016, while traveling in Italy, Mr. Papadopoulos met a London-based professor of diplomacy who has deep ties to the Russian government. The professor took interest in Mr. Papadopoulos \u201cbecause of his status with the campaign,\u201d court documents said. The professor is Joseph Mifsud, according to a Senate aide familiar with emails in which Mr. Mifsud is mentioned. Two Senate committees are conducting Russia inquiries of their own, and investigators have been poring over thousands of emails produced by the Trump campaign.                 George Papadopoulos, an adviser to the Trump campaign, contacted campaign officials at least 11 times from March to June 2016 about a potential meeting.             Mr. Mifsud introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to others, including someone with ties to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a woman who he believed was a relative of Mr. Putin. Mr. Papadopoulos repeatedly tried to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials, court records show. Advertisement \u201cWe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\u201d the woman, who was not identified, told Mr. Papadopoulos in an email. She was not actually a relative of Mr. Putin, according to court documents. Campaign officials knew that Mr. Papadopoulos was developing contacts in Russia, court documents show. He repeatedly tried to arrange a formal meeting for Mr. Trump in Russia. Among those in the campaign who knew about the contacts was Sam Clovis, who helped supervise the foreign-policy team, according to a former campaign aide. Mr. Clovis could not be reached for comment.

Ultimately, senior campaign officials said that Mr. Trump should not make the trip and leave it to \u201csomeone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal,\u201d according to an email cited in court papers. No campaign official made a formal trip to Russia. When F.B.I. agents approached Mr. Papadopoulos on Jan. 27, he lied about his Russian contacts, according to court documents. That day, Mr. Trump invited the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to dinner at the White House and asked him to pledge loyalty, according to notes Mr. Comey took at the time. As the F.B.I. scrutiny continued, Mr. Papadopoulos changed his phone number and deleted his Facebook account, which he had used to communicate with the Russians. The F.B.I. has obtained emails, text messages, and the transcript of chats on Facebook and Skype records as part of its investigation. F.B.I. agents quietly arrested Mr. Papadopoulos at Dulles International Airport outside Washington on July 27, a day after agents raided Mr. Manafort\u2019s Virginia home. The Justice Department disclosed on Monday that Mr. Manafort had withheld evidence from Mr. Mueller that was discovered during that raid. With the charges against Mr. Manafort, Mr. Mueller has taken a broad view of his mandate. He was tapped to investigate Russian election meddling, whether anyone around Mr. Trump was involved and other crimes that followed from that investigation. The charges against Mr. Manafort do not directly relate to Mr. Trump or the campaign. Mr. Manafort had been under investigation in New York and Virginia until Mr. Mueller was appointed and assumed control. The special counsel has struck an aggressive posture in the case, and Monday\u2019s charges were no exception. The Justice Department often invites lawyers to meet and discuss potential indictments. It is both an opportunity for lawyers to argue for leniency, and for prosecutors to spot potential weaknesses in their case. Advertisement But on Friday night, people close to Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates and lawyers involved in the investigation said they had received no indication that an indictment against them was imminent.
