            "content": "William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, author, philanthropist, and co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation along with Paul Allen.[2][3] In 1975, Gates and Allen launched Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[4][a] Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself.[7] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[8] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[9] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[10] Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[11] Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000. Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[12] As of September 2017[update], he is the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$84.8\u00a0billion.[1] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13] The foundation works to save lives and improve global health, and is working with Rotary International to eliminate polio.[14]   Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (b. 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929\u20131994). His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish.[15][16] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates' maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" because his father had the \"II\" suffix.[17] Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him.[18] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[19][20][21] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that \"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing\".[22] At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school.[23] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.[24] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, \"There was just something neat about the machine.\"[25] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students\u00a0\u2013  Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans\u00a0\u2013  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[26][27] At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype. Subsequently, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with \"a disproportionate number of interesting girls.\"[28] He later stated that \"it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.\"[25] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[29] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.[30] Gates was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.[31] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[32][33] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[34] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO. He maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation from the company in 2014.[35] In his second year, Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[36] presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years;[36][37] its successor is faster by only one percent.[36] His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[38] While Gates was a student at Harvard,[39] he did not have a definite study plan, and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[40] The MITS Altair 8800 was released the following year. The new computer was based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[41] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much their son wanted to start his own company.[39] Gates explained his decision to leave Harvard, saying \"...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] leave [of absence].\"[42] After Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which demonstrated the Altair 8800, he contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[43] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,[44] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership \"Micro-Soft\" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.[44] Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name \"Microsoft\" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.[44] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies. Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 percent of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair \"hobby market\" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[45] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[44] The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979.[43] During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.[46][unreliable source?] IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating system for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[47] Big Blue first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[48] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.[49] Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.[49] They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[50] Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. PC Magazine asked if Gates were \"the man behind the machine?\",[47] and InfoWorld quoted an expert as stating \"it's Gates' computer\".[51] Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.[43] Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.[52] From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that \"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\"[53] Another executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor.\"[54] Gates was an executive who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[55][56] He interrupted presentations with such comments as \"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\"[57] and \"Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?\"[58] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.[57] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, \"I'll do it over the weekend.\"[59][60][61] During Microsoft's early history, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[62] but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products.[60] He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, \"Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.\"[63] On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that over the next two years he would transition out of his day-to-day role to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[64] Many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as, \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[65] BusinessWeek reported: Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[66] Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, \"Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree.\"[67] Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[67] In 2008, Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation.[68] As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a \"Yes\", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a \"Yes\". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about \"nothing\" (Seinfeld).[69] In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.[70] Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8\u00a0billion to US$78.5\u00a0billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[71] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside new CEO Satya Nadella.[10][72] Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: \"... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism.\" Gates also identified innovation as the \"real driver of progress\" and pronounced that \"America's way better today than it's ever been.\"[73] Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of superintelligence; in a Reddit \"ask me anything\", he stated that First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[74][75][76][77] In a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would \"highly recommend\" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[78] Gates' days are planned for him, similar to the US President's schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.[79] Gates married Melinda French on a golf course on the Hawaiian island of Lanai on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002). The family resides in a modern design mansion, which is an earth-sheltered house in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina near Seattle in Washington State, United States. According to 2007 King County public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125\u00a0million, and the annual property taxes are $991,000. The 66,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (6,100\u00a0m2) estate has a 60-foot (18\u00a0m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (230\u00a0m2) gym and a 1,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (93\u00a0m2) dining room.[80] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith: The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.[81] In the same interview, Gates said: \"I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm\u00a0\u2013 not all\u00a0\u2013 that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\"[81] The Codex Leicester is one of Gates' private acquisitions. He purchased the collection of famous scientific writings by Leonardo da Vinci for $30.8\u00a0million at an auction in 1994.[82] Gates is also known for being an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[83] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[84][85] In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101\u00a0billion.[86] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet.[87] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[88] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[89][90] Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014[91][92] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40\u00a0billion to more than US$82\u00a0billion.[93] Bill Gates has held the top spot on the list of The World's Billionaires for 18 out of the past 23 years.[94] Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.[95] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[96] In 2016, he was discussing his gaming habits when he revealed that he was color-blind.[97] In a BBC interview, Gates claimed \"I've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so... I've paid over $6 billion in taxes.\"[98] He is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich.[99] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13] Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the \"William H. Gates Foundation.\" In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6\u00a0billion.[100][101] The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[102][103] Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[104] As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28\u00a0billion to charity;[105] the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.[106] The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[107] The foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat Vitamin A deficiency.[108] Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in The Power of Half.[109] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a commitment they called the \"Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge.\" The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.[110][111][112] Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20\u00a0million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[113] The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[114] Gates also donated $6\u00a0million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[115] On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).[116] Since about 2005, Bill Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the \"Reinvent the Toilet Challenge\", which has received considerable media interest.[117] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was \"produced from human feces\" in 2014\u00a0\u2013 in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni-processor.[118][119] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[120] Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10\u00a0million each as their inheritance. With only $30\u00a0million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.[121] In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell to the developing world.[122] In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[123] It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[124] The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students.[125] The scholarship program is administered by the United Negro College Fund.[126] In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when he decided to donate $50 million to UNAIDS through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[127][128] On April 29, 2017, Bill Gates partnered with Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer in playing a noncompetitive tennis match to a packed house at Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[129] Federer and Gates played against John Isner and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McReady. Gates and Federer won the game 6\u20134. In 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's 400 Richest People in America issue. He was worth $1.25\u00a0billion and was the world's youngest self-made billionaire.[12] Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes The World's Billionaires list and was the wealthiest from 1995 to 1996,[130] 1998 to 2007, 2009, and has been since 2014.[1] Gates was number one on Forbes' 400 Richest Americans list from 1993 through to 2007.[131][needs update] Time magazine named Gates one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th century, as well as one of the 100 most influential people of 2004, 2005, and 2006. Time also collectively named Gates, his wife Melinda and U2's lead singer Bono as the 2005 Persons of the Year for their humanitarian efforts.[132] In 2006, he was voted eighth in the list of \"Heroes of our time\".[133] Gates was listed in the Sunday Times power list in 1999, named CEO of the year by Chief Executive Officers magazine in 1994, ranked number one in the \"Top 50 Cyber Elite\" by Time in 1998, ranked number two in the Upside Elite 100 in 1999, and was included in The Guardian as one of the \"Top 100 influential people in media\" in 2001.[134] According to Forbes, Gates was ranked as the fourth most powerful person in the world in 2012,[135] up from fifth in 2011.[136] In 1994, he was honored as the twentieth Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society. In 1999, Gates received New York Institute of Technology's President's Medal.[137] Gates has received honorary doctorates from Nyenrode Business Universiteit, Breukelen, The Netherlands, in 2000;[138] the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2002;[139] Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2005; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in April 2007;[140] Harvard University in June 2007;[141] the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, in 2007,[142] and Cambridge University in June 2009.[143] He was also made an honorary trustee of Peking University in 2007.[144] Gates was made an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.[145] In November 2006, he was awarded the Placard of the Order of the Aztec Eagle, together with his wife Melinda who was awarded the Insignia of the same order, both for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in Mexico, and specifically in the program \"Un pa\u00eds de lectores\".[146] Gates received the 2010 Bower Award for Business Leadership from The Franklin Institute for his achievements at Microsoft and his philanthropic work.[147] Also in 2010, he was honored with the Silver Buffalo Award by the Boy Scouts of America, its highest award for adults, for his service to youth.[148] Entomologists named Bill Gates' flower fly, Eristalis gatesi, in his honor in 1997.[149] In 2002, Bill and Melinda Gates received the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged.[150] In 2006, Gates received the James C.

            "content": "Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates (born October 28, 1955) and his partner Paul Allen founded and built the world's largest software business, Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Gates announced that he was stepping down as Microsoft's chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In March 1986, Bill Gates took Microsoft public with an initial public offering (IPO) of $21 per share, making him an instant millionaire at age 31. Gates held 45 percent of the company's 24.7 million shares, making his stake at that time $234 million of Microsoft's $520 million.\u00a0 Over time, the company's stock increased in value and split numerous times. In 1987, Bill Gates became a billionaire when the stock hit $90.75 a share. Since then, Gates has been at the top, or at least near the top, of Forbes' annual list of the top 400 wealthiest people in America. In 1999, with stock prices at an all-time high and the stock splitting eight-fold since its IPO, Gates' wealth briefly topped $101 billion. In 1997, Gates and his family moved into a 55,000-square-foot, $54-million house on the shore of Lake Washington. Though the house serves as a business center, it is said to be very cozy for the couple and their three children.\u00a0 In 1987, a 23-year-old Microsoft product manager named Melinda French caught the eye of Bill Gates, then 32. The very bright and organized Melinda was a perfect match for Gates. In time, their relationship grew as they discovered an intimate and intellectual connection. On January 1, 1994, Melinda and Bill were married in Hawaii.\u00a0 Following the devastating death of his mother to breast cancer just a few months after their wedding, Bill and Melinda took some time off in 1995 to travel and get a new perspective on life and the world. In 1996, their first daughter, Jennifer, was born. Their son, Rory, was born in 1999, and a second daughter, Phoebe, arrived in 2002. READ ARTICLE: 7 Fun Facts About Bill Gates. In 1994, Bill and Melinda Gates established the William H. Gates Foundation, which was dedicated to supporting education, world health and investment in low-income communities. With Melinda's influence, Bill had taken an interest in becoming a civic leader in the footsteps of his mother, studying the philanthropic work of American industrial titans Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. He realized that he had an obligation to give more of his wealth to charity. In 2000, the couple combined several family foundations and made a $28 billion contribution to form the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2000, Bill Gates stepped down from the day-to-day operations of Microsoft, turning over the job of CEO to college friend Steve Ballmer, who had been with Microsoft since 1980. He positioned himself as chief software architect so he could concentrate on what was for him the more passionate side of the business, though he remained chairman of the board.\u00a0 Over the next few years, Bill\u2019s involvement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation occupied much of his time and even more of his interest. In 2006, Gates announced he was transitioning himself from full-time work at Microsoft to devote more quality time to the foundation. His last full day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. In February 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in order to move into a new position as technology adviser; longtime Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was replaced by 46-year-old Satya Nadella. Gates continues to devote much of his time and energy to the work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The organization tackles international and domestic issues, such as health and education and helping students in the United States become college-ready. In 2015, Gates spoke out in favor of national Common Core standards in grades K through 12 and charter schools. Gates also proved to be a groundbreaking employer when, around this time, the foundation announced that it would give its employees a year's paid leave after the birth or the adoption of a child.\u00a0 Bill Gates was born William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington.\u00a0 Bill Gates grew up in an upper middle-class family with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their father, William H. Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law student when he met his future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an athletic, outgoing student at the University of Washington, actively involved in student affairs and leadership. The Gates family atmosphere was warm and close, and all three children were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence. Bill showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family athletic games at their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished in playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled at Monopoly.\u00a0 Bill had a very close relationship with his mother, Mary, who after a brief career as a teacher devoted her time to helping raise the children and working on civic affairs and with charities. She also served on several corporate boards, including those of the First Interstate Bank in Seattle (founded by her grandfather), the United Way and International Business Machines (IBM). She would often take Bill along when she volunteered in schools and at community organizations. Bill was a voracious reader as a child, spending many hours poring over reference books such as the encyclopedia. Around the age of 11 or 12, Bill's parents began to have concerns about his behavior. He was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times, and his parents worried he might become a loner. Though they were strong believers in public education, when Bill turned 13, they enrolled him at Seattle's exclusive preparatory Lakeside School. He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, excelling in math and science, but also doing very well in drama and English. While at Lakeside School, a Seattle computer company offered to provide computer time for the students. The Mother's Club used proceeds from the school's rummage sale to purchase a teletype terminal for students to use. Bill Gates became entranced with what a computer could do and spent much of his free time working on the terminal. He wrote a tic-tac-toe program in BASIC computer language that allowed users to play against the computer. Gates graduated from Lakeside in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the college SAT test, a feat of intellectual achievement that for several years he boasted about when introducing himself to new people. Gates enrolled at Harvard University in the fall of 1973, originally thinking of a career in law. But his freshman year saw him spend more of his time in the computer lab than in class. Gates did not really have a study regimen. Instead, he could get by on a few hours of sleep, cram for a test, and pass with a reasonable grade. Much to his parents' dismay, within two years Gates dropped out of college in 1975 to pursue his business, Microsoft, with partner Paul Allen. At Lakeside School Gates met Paul Allen, who was two years his senior. The pair became fast friends, bonding over their common enthusiasm for computers, even though they were very different people. Allen was more reserved and shy. Bill was feisty and at times combative. Regardless of their differences, they both spent much of their free time together working on programs. Occasionally, the two disagreed and would clash over who was right or who should run the computer lab. On one occasion, their argument escalated to the point where Allen banned Gates from the computer lab.\u00a0 At one point, Gates and Allen had their school computer privileges revoked for taking advantage of software glitches to obtain free computer time from the company that provided the computers. After their probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to debug the program. During this time, Gates developed a payroll program for the computer company the boys hacked into and a scheduling program for the school. In 1970, at the age of 15, Bill Gates and Paul Allen went into business together, developing \"Traf-o-Data,\" a computer program that monitored traffic patterns in Seattle. They netted $20,000 for their efforts. Gates and Allen wanted to start their own company, but Gates' parents wanted him to finish school and go on to college, where they hoped he would work to become a lawyer. Allen went to Washington State University, while Gates went to Harvard, though the pair stayed in touch. After attending college for two years, Allen dropped out and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to work for Honeywell. Around this time, he showed Gates an edition of Popular Electronics magazine featuring an article on the Altair 8800 mini-computer kit. Both boys were fascinated with the possibilities of what this computer could create in the world of personal computing.\u00a0 The Altair was made by a small company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). Gates and Allen contacted the company, proclaiming that they were working on a BASIC software program that would run the Altair computer. In reality, they didn't have an Altair to work with or the code to run it, but they wanted to know if MITS was interested in someone developing such software.\u00a0 MITS was, and its president, Ed Roberts, asked the boys for a demonstration. Gates and Allen scrambled, spending the next two months writing the software at Harvard's computer lab. Allen traveled to Albuquerque for a test run at MITS, never having tried it out on an Altair computer. It worked perfectly. Allen was hired at MITS, and Gates soon left Harvard to work with him. Together they founded Microsoft.\u00a0 Paul Allen remained with Microsoft until 1983, when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. Though his cancer went into remission a year later with intensive treatment, Allen resigned from the company. Rumors abound as to why Allen left Microsoft. Some say Bill Gates pushed him out, but many say it was a life-changing experience for Allen and he saw there were other opportunities that he could invest his time in. In 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen formed Micro-Soft, a blend of \"micro-computer\" and \"software\" (they dropped the hyphen to Microsoft within a year). Although the company started out on shaky footing, by 1979 Microsoft was grossing approximately $2.5 million, and, at the age of 23, Gates placed himself as the head of the company. With his acumen for software development and a keen business sense, he led the company and worked as its spokesperson. Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, often rewriting code himself when he saw it necessary.\u00a0 Following the development of software for IBM, between 1979 and 1981 Microsoft's growth exploded. Staff increased from 25 to 128, and revenue shot up from $2.5 million to $16 million. In mid-1981, Gates and Allen incorporated Microsoft, and Gates was appointed president and chairman of the board. Allen was named executive vice president. At first, all was not smooth sailing. Although Microsoft\u2019s BASIC software program for the Altair computer netted the company a fee and royalties, it wasn't meeting their overhead. According to Gates' later account, only about 10 percent of the people using BASIC in the Altair computer had actually paid for it. Microsoft's BASIC software was popular with computer hobbyists, who obtained pre-market copies and were reproducing and distributing them for free. At this time, much of the personal computer enthusiasts were people not in it for the money. They felt the ease of reproduction and distribution allowed them to share software with friends and fellow computer enthusiasts. Bill Gates thought differently. He saw the free distribution of software as stealing, especially when it involved software that was created to be sold. In February 1976, Gates wrote an open letter to computer hobbyists, saying that continued distribution and use of software without paying for it would \"prevent good software from being written.\" In essence, pirating software would discourage developers from investing time and money into creating quality software. The letter was unpopular with computer enthusiasts, but Gates stuck to his beliefs and would use the threat of innovation as a defense when faced with charges of unfair business practices. Gates had an acrimonious relationship with MITS president Ed Roberts, often resulting in shouting matches. The combative Gates clashed with Roberts on software development and the direction of the business. Roberts considered Gates spoiled and obnoxious. In 1977, Roberts sold MITS to another computer company and went back to Georgia to enter medical school and become a doctor.\u00a0 Gates and Allen were on their own. The pair had to sue the new owner of MITS to retain the software rights they had developed for Altair. Microsoft wrote software in different formats for other computer companies, and, at the beginning of 1979, Gates moved the company's operations to Bellevue, Washington, just east of Seattle. Gates was glad to be home again in the Pacific Northwest, and threw himself into his work. All 25 employees of the young company had broad responsibilities for all aspects of the operation, product development, business development and marketing.\u00a0 As the computer industry began to grow, with companies like Apple, Intel and IBM developing hardware and components, Bill was continuously out on the road touting the merits of Microsoft software applications. He often took his mother with him. Mary was highly respected and well connected with her membership on several corporate boards, including IBM's. It was through Mary that Bill Gates met the CEO of IBM. In November 1980, IBM was looking for software that would operate their upcoming personal computer (PC) and approached Microsoft. Legend has it that at the first meeting with Bill Gates someone at IBM mistook him for an office assistant and asked him to serve coffee.\u00a0 Gates did look very young, but he quickly impressed IBM, convincing them that he and his company could meet their needs. The only problem was that Microsoft had not developed the basic operating system that would run IBM's new computers. Not to be stopped, Gates bought an operating system that was developed to run on computers similar to IBM's PC. He made a deal with the software's developer, making Microsoft the exclusive licensing agent and later full owner of the software but not telling them of the IBM deal. The company later sued Microsoft and Gates for withholding important information. Microsoft settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, but neither Gates nor Microsoft admitted to any wrongdoing. Gates had to adapt the newly purchased software to work for the IBM PC. He delivered it for a $50,000 fee, the same price he had paid for the software in its original form. IBM wanted to buy the source code, which would have given them the information to the operating system. Gates refused, instead proposing that IBM pay a licensing fee for copies of the software sold with their computers. Doing this allowed Microsoft to license the software they called MS-DOS to any other PC manufacturer, should other computer companies clone the IBM PC, which they soon did. Microsoft also released software called Softcard, which allowed Microsoft BASIC to operate on Apple II machines. By 1983, Microsoft was going global with offices in Great Britain and Japan, and with 30 percent of the world's computers running on its software.\u00a0 Though their rivalry is legend, Microsoft and Apple shared many of their early innovations. In 1981, Apple, at the time led by Steve Jobs, invited Microsoft to help develop software for Macintosh computers. Some developers were involved in both Microsoft development and the development of Microsoft applications for Macintosh. The collaboration could be seen in some shared names between the Microsoft and Macintosh systems.\u00a0 It was through this knowledge sharing that Microsoft was to develop Windows, a system that used a mouse to drive a graphic interface, displaying text and images on the screen. This differed greatly from the text-and-keyboard driven MS-DOS system where all text formatting showed on the screen as code and not what actually would be printed. Bill Gates quickly recognized the threat this kind of software might pose for MS-DOS and Microsoft overall. For the unsophisticated user\u2014which was most of the buying public\u2014the graphic imagery of the competing VisiCorp software used in a Macintosh system would be so much easier to use.\u00a0 Gates announced in an advertising campaign that a new Microsoft operating system was about to be developed that would use a graphic interface. It was to be called \"Windows,\" and would be compatible with all PC software products developed on the MS-DOS system. The announcement was a bluff, in that Microsoft had no such program under development. But as a marketing tactic it was sheer genius, as nearly 30 percent of the computer market was using the MS-DOS system and would wait for Windows software rather than change to a new system. Without people willing to change formats, software developers were unwilling to write programs for the VisiCorp system and it lost momentum by early 1985. In November 1985, nearly two years after his announcement, Bill Gates and Microsoft launched Windows. Visually the Windows system looked very similar to the Macintosh system Apple Computer Corporation had introduced nearly two years earlier. Apple had earlier given Microsoft full access to their technology while it was working on making Microsoft products compatible for Apple computers. Gates had advised Apple to license their software but they ignored the advice, being more interested in selling computers.\u00a0 Once again, Gates took full advantage of the situation and created a software format that was strikingly similar to the Macintosh. Apple threatened to sue, and Microsoft retaliated, saying it would delay shipment of its Microsoft-compatible software for Macintosh users. In the end, Microsoft prevailed in the courts because it could prove that while there were similarities in how the two software systems operated, each individual function was distinctly different. Bill Gates' intelligence allowed him to be able to see all sides of the software industry\u2014product development and corporate strategy. When analyzing any corporate move, he would develop a profile of all the possible cases and run through them, asking questions about anything that could possibly happen.\u00a0 Despite the success of Microsoft, Bill Gates never felt totally secure. Always looking over his shoulder to check on the competition, Gates developed a white-hot drive and competitive spirit. Gates expected everyone in the company to have the same dedication. Gates' assistant reported coming to work early to find someone sleeping under a desk. She considered calling security or the police, until she discovered it was Gates. His confrontational management style also became legend, as he would challenge employees and their ideas to keep the creative process going. An unprepared presenter could hear, \"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\" from Gates. But this was as much a test of the rigor of the employee as it was Gates' passion for his company. He was constantly checking the people around him to see if they were really convinced of their ideas. Outside the company, Bill Gates was gaining a reputation as a ruthless competitor. Several tech companies, led by IBM, began to develop their own operating system, called OS/2, to replace MS-DOS. Rather than give in to the pressure, Gates pushed ahead with the Windows software, improving its operation and expanding its uses. In 1989, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Office, which bundled office productivity applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel into one system that was compatible with all Microsoft products. The applications were not as easily compatible with OS/2. Microsoft's new version of Windows sold 100,000 copies in just two weeks, and OS/2 soon faded away. This left Microsoft with a virtual monopoly on operating systems for PCs. Soon the Federal Trade Commission began to investigate Microsoft for unfair marketing practices. Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft faced a string of Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department investigations. Some related allegations that Microsoft made unfair deals with computer manufacturers who installed the Windows operating system on their computers. Other charges involved Microsoft forcing computer manufactures to sell Microsoft's Internet Explorer as a condition for selling the Windows operating system with their computers. At one point, Microsoft faced a possible break up of its two divisions\u2014operating systems and software development. Microsoft defended itself, harking back to Bill Gates' earlier battles with software piracy and proclaiming that such restrictions were a threat to innovation. Eventually, Microsoft was able to find a settlement with the federal government to avoid a breakup.\u00a0 Through it all, Gates found some inventive ways to deflect the pressure with lighthearted commercials and public appearances at computer trade shows during which he posed as Star Trek's Mr. Spock. Gates continued to run the company and weather the federal investigations through the 1990s. In addition to being one of the richest and most successful businessmen in the history of the world, Bill Gates has also received numerous awards for philanthropic work. Time magazine named Gates one of the most influential people of the 20th century. The magazine also named Gates and his wife Melinda, along with rock band U2's lead singer, Bono, as the 2005 Persons of the Year. Gates holds several honorary doctorates from universities throughout the world. He was knighted as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.\u00a0 In 2006, Gates and his wife were awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle by the Mexican government for their philanthropic work throughout the world in the areas of health and education. In 2016, Gates and his wife Melinda were recognized for their philanthropic work when they were named recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.

            "content": "Bill Gates has committed his fortune to moving the world beyond fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. In his offices overlooking Lake Washington, just east of Seattle, Bill Gates grabbed a legal pad recently and began covering it in his left-handed scrawl. He scribbled arrows by each margin of the pad, both pointing inward. The arrow near the left margin, he said, represented how governments worldwide could stimulate ingenuity to combat climate change by dramatically increasing spending on research and development. \u201cThe push is the R&D,\u201d he said, before indicating the arrow on the right. \u201cThe pull is the carbon tax.\u201d Between the arrows he sketched boxes to represent areas, such as deployment of new technology, where, he argued, private investors should foot the bill. He has pledged to commit $2 billion himself. \u201cYes, the government will be somewhat inept,\u201d he said brusquely, swatting aside one objection as a trivial statement of the obvious. \u201cBut the private sector is in general inept. How many companies do venture capitalists invest in that go poorly? By far most of them.\u201d Bill Gates's First Job Gates is on a solo global lobbying campaign to press his species to accomplish something on a scale it has never attempted before. He wants human beings to invent their way out of the coming collision with planetary climate change, accelerating a transition to new forms of energy that might normally take a century or more. To head off a rise in average global temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels\u2014the goal set by international agreement\u2014Gates believes that by 2050, wealthy nations like China and the United States, the most prodigious belchers of greenhouse gases, must be adding no more carbon to the skies. Those who study energy patterns say we are in a gradual transition from oil and coal to natural gas, a fuel that emits far less carbon but still contributes to global warming. Gates thinks that we can\u2019t accept this outcome, and that our best chance to vault over natural gas to a globally applicable, carbon-free source of energy is to drive innovation \u201cat an unnaturally high pace.\u201d When I sat down to hear his case a few weeks ago, he didn\u2019t evince much patience for the argument that American politicians couldn\u2019t agree even on whether climate change is real, much less on how to combat it. \u201cIf you\u2019re not bringing math skills to the problem,\u201d he said with a sort of amused asperity, \u201cthen representative democracy is a problem.\u201d What follows is a condensed transcript of his remarks, lightly edited for clarity. On whether new commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions expected at the United Nations climate-change conference in Paris in December mean the world is now serious about the problem: It\u2019s good to have people making commitments. It\u2019s really good. But if you really look at those commitments\u2014which are not binding, but even if you say they will all be achieved\u2014they fall dramatically short of the reductions required to reduce CO2 emissions enough to prevent a scenario where global temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius. I mean, these commitments won\u2019t even be a third of what you need. And one of the interesting things about this problem is, if you have a country that says, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to get on a pathway for an 80 percent reduction in CO2 by 2050,\u201d it might make a commitment that \u201cHey, by 2030, we\u2019ll be at 30 percent reduction.\u201d But that first 30 percent is dramatically, dramatically easier than getting to 80 percent. So everything that\u2019s hard has been saved for post-2030\u2014and even these 2030 commitments aren\u2019t enough. And many of them won\u2019t be achieved. On why the free market won\u2019t develop new forms of energy fast enough:  Well, there\u2019s no fortune to be made. Even if you have a new energy source that costs the same as today\u2019s and emits no CO2, it will be uncertain compared with what\u2019s tried-and-true and already operating at unbelievable scale and has gotten through all the regulatory problems, like \u201cOkay, what do you do with coal ash?\u201d and \u201cHow do you guarantee something is safe?\u201d Without a substantial carbon tax, there\u2019s no incentive for innovators or plant buyers to switch. And for energy as a whole, the incentive to invest is quite limited, because unlike digital products\u2014where you get very rapid adoption and so, within the period that your trade secret stays secret or your patent gives you a 20-year exclusive, you can reap incredible returns\u2014almost everything that\u2019s been invented in energy was invented more than 20 years before it got scaled usage. So if you go back to various energy innovators, actually, they didn\u2019t do that well financially. The rewards to society of these energy advances\u2014not much of that is captured by the individual innovator, because it\u2019s a very conservative market. So the R&D amount in energy is surprisingly low compared with medicine or digital stuff, where both the government spending and the private-sector spending is huge. On the pace of energy transitions historically: What\u2019s amazing is how our intense energy usage is one and the same as modern civilization. That is, for all the great things that happened in terms of human lifestyle, life span, and growing food before 1800, civilization didn\u2019t change dramatically until we started using coal in the U.K. in the 1800s. Coal replaced wood. But the wave of wood to coal is about a 50- or 60-year wave. If it was just about economics, if we had no global warming to think about, the slowly-but-surely pace of these transitions would be okay. If you look at one of these forecasts, they all say about the same thing: What you look at is a picture that\u2019s pretty gradual, with natural gas continuing to gain at the expense of both coal and oil. But, you know, 1-percent-a year-type change. If you look at that from a greenhouse-gas point of view\u2014if you look at forecasts\u2014every single year we\u2019ll be emitting more greenhouse gases than the previous year. On whether we\u2019ve ever done anything as big, as a species, as what he\u2019s asking for now: Well, sort of no. Because the scale of it is very big. People can talk about the Manhattan Project during World War II\u2014the challenge of \u201cHey, should we get a nuclear weapon before, potentially, the Japanese or Germans do?\u201d The speed of innovation there really was mind-blowing. And they had to find two paths to get there. One was enriching uranium; the other was breeding plutonium. And, in fact, the first bomb was a uranium bomb; the second bomb was plutonium. Both paths gave them what they\u2019d hoped for. So there\u2019s some amazing things\u2014people look at the digital realm and see the pace of innovation. And that does kind of spoil you, because you can just put something up on the Web, and a hundred million people can download it. But what we\u2019re asking ourselves to do here is change energy\u2014and that includes all of transport, all of electricity, all of household usage, and all of industrial usage. And those are all huge areas of usage. And somebody\u2019ll say to you, \u201cWell, hey, lighting, LED technology, is going to reduce energy consumption from lighting by over half.\u201d That\u2019s true; it\u2019s a miracle, it\u2019s fantastic. But unfortunately, there\u2019s no equivalent in many of these other things, like making fertilizer or making electricity in a general sense. There\u2019s opportunities to conserve that are really good. But the world is going to consume much more energy 30 years from now than it does today. On whether we should all be driving electric cars: People think, Oh, well, I\u2019ll just get an electric car. There are places where if you buy an electric car, you\u2019re actually increasing CO2 emissions, because the electricity infrastructure is emitting more CO2 than you would have if you\u2019d had a gasoline-powered car. On what it will take to accelerate the transition from carbon-emitting energy: When people viewed cancer as a problem, the U.S. government\u2014and it\u2019s a huge favor to the world\u2014declared a war on cancer, and now we fund all health research at about $30 billion a year, of which about $5 billion goes to cancer. We got serious and did a lot of R&D, and then we got the private sector involved in taking that R&D and building breakthrough drugs. In energy, no government\u2014including the U.S., which is in almost every category the big R&D funder\u2014has really made a dramatic increase. It was increased somewhat under Carter and then cut back under Reagan, and it\u2019s now about $6 billion a year\u2014that\u2019s the U.S. piece, which, compared with the importance to our economy in general, is too low. Realistically, we may not get more than a doubling in government funding of energy R&D\u2014but I would love to see a tripling, to $18 billion a year from the U.S. government to fund basic research alone. Now, as a percentage of the government budget, that\u2019s not gigantic. But we are at a time when the flexibility\u2014because of health costs and other things, but primarily health costs\u2014of the budget is very, very squeezed. But you could do a few-percent tax on all of energy consumption, or you could use the general revenue. This is not an unachievable amount of money. On why, considering the level of debate in the presidential campaign, he thinks this kind of investment is imaginable: Well, the success of the United States in medical research is really incredible. I mean, it\u2019s phenomenal. We spend $30 billion a year of government money, and the private sector goes out and comes up with new drugs. It\u2019s an industry that the U.S. is by far the leader in\u2014creating wonderful jobs, great miracle cures\u2014and that is working super, super well, but we spend more than all other countries put together. And the U.S. lead in health technologies, including drugs, is gigantic, just like the U.S. lead in digital technologies is gigantic. In the case of the digital technologies, the path back to government R&D is a bit more complex, because nowadays most of the R&D has moved to the private sector. But the original Internet comes from the government, the original chip-foundry stuff comes from the government\u2014and even today there\u2019s some government money taking on some of the more advanced things and making sure the universities have the knowledge base that maintains that lead. So I\u2019d say the overall record for the United States on government R&D is very, very good. Now, in the case of climate change, because there\u2019s so many possible solutions, it\u2019s not like the Manhattan Project. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s saying, \u201cHey, pick just one approach, and pick some ranch in New Mexico, and just have those guys kind of hang out there.\u201d Here, we want to give a little bit of money to the guy who thinks that high wind will work; we want to give a little bit of money to the guy who thinks that taking sunlight and making oil directly out of sunlight will work. So there\u2019s dozens of those ideas, and there\u2019s enabling technologies for those ideas. That\u2019s the kind of thing that we should be funding more of. On the limits of wind power and solar photovoltaic cells: Wind has grown super-fast, on a very subsidized basis. Solar, off a smaller base, has been growing even faster\u2014again on a highly subsidized basis. But it\u2019s absolutely fair to say that even the modest R&D that\u2019s been done, and the various deployment incentives that are there, have worked well. Now, unfortunately, solar photovoltaic is still not economical, but the biggest problem of all is this intermittency. That is, we need energy 24 hours a day. So, putting aside hydro\u2014which unfortunately can\u2019t grow much\u2014the primary new zero-CO2 sources are intermittent. Now, nuclear is a non-CO2 source, but it\u2019s had its own problems in terms of costs, big safety problems, making sure you can deal with the waste, making sure the plutonium isn\u2019t used to make weapons. So my view is that the biggest problem for the two lead candidates is that storage looks to be so difficult. It\u2019s kind of ironic: Germany, by installing so much rooftop solar, has it that both their coal plants and their rooftop solar are available in the summer, and the price of power during the day actually goes negative\u2014they pay people to take it. Then at night the only source is the coal, and because the energy companies have to recover their capital costs, they either raise the price because they\u2019re not getting any return for the day, or they slowly go bankrupt. There are many people working on storage\u2014batteries are a form of storage, and there\u2019s a few others, like compressed air, hot metals. But it\u2019s not at all clear that we will get grid-scale economic storage. We\u2019re more than a factor of 10 away from the economics to get that. On the self-defeating claims of some clean-energy enthusiasts: They have this statement that the cost of solar photovoltaic is the same as hydrocarbon\u2019s. And that\u2019s one of those misleadingly meaningless statements. What they mean is that at noon in Arizona, the cost of that kilowatt-hour is the same as a hydrocarbon kilowatt-hour. But it doesn\u2019t come at night, it doesn\u2019t come after the sun hasn\u2019t shone, so the fact that in that one moment you reach parity, so what? The reading public, when they see things like that, they underestimate how hard this thing is. So false solutions like divestment or \u201cOh, it\u2019s easy to do\u201d hurt our ability to fix the problems. Distinguishing a real solution from a false solution is actually very complicated. On the role of private investors: I think dozens and dozens of approaches should be funded at the R&D level, and then people like myself, who can afford to take big risks with start-up companies, should\u2014because of climate change\u2014be willing to put some number of billions into the spin-offs that will come out of that government-funded activity. You can\u2019t expect that it will be like a digital thing. So you do have to bring a more patient investor, and even a lower return threshold, to this than to other things. People often talk about, \u201cWell, the solution that gets us beyond the CO2-based energy economy will be a mix of things.\u201d And it will be a mix\u2014but a few will be very big. And so the companies that find whatever turns out to be the mainstream, they will do super, super well. But there won\u2019t be as many successes here as there are in an area like software, where there\u2019s a lot more variety. On why energy is a global challenge: People can always say, \u201cWell, my country is such a small part of it\u2014why should I make the sacrifice? Because I don\u2019t know for sure that the other countries are going to do their part of it.\u201d We don\u2019t have a world government. Fortunately, we don\u2019t have that many world problems\u2014most problems can be solved locally\u2014but this one is a world problem. Carbon is not a local pollutant. It mixes in the global atmosphere in a matter of days. So it doesn\u2019t really matter whether it\u2019s a coal plant in China or a coal plant in the U.S.\u2014the heating effect for the entire globe is the same. On the dangerous certainty of environmentalists: The heating levels have not tracked the climate models exactly, and the skeptics have had a heyday with that. It\u2019s all within the error-bar range. To me, it\u2019s pretty clear that there\u2019s nothing that relieves this as a big problem. But when people act like we have this great certainty, they somewhat undermine the credibility. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in this, but on both the good and the bad side. By overclaiming, or even trying to ascribe current things more to climate change than to other effects, environmentalists lend weight to the skeptics. Like, in the near term, the Pacific oscillation, this El Ni\u00f1o thing, has a much bigger impact on current weather than climate change has had so far. Now, climate change keeps climbing all the time\u2014it just keeps summing, summing, summing, and adding up. So, as you get up to 2050, 2080, 2100, its effect overwhelms the Pacific oscillation. So we have to have dramatic change here. It\u2019s unprecedented to move this quickly, to change an infrastructure of this scale\u2014it\u2019s really unprecedented. And, when you turn to India and say, \u201cPlease cut your carbon emissions, and do it with energy that\u2019s really expensive, subsidized energy,\u201d that\u2019s really putting them in a tough position, because energy for them means a kid can read at night, or having an air conditioner or a refrigerator, or being able to eat fresh foods, or get to your job, or buy fertilizer. That\u2019s why we really need to solve that dilemma, we need innovation that gives us energy that\u2019s cheaper than today\u2019s hydrocarbon energy, that has zero CO2 emissions, and that\u2019s as reliable as today\u2019s overall energy system. And when you put all those requirements together, we need an energy miracle. That may make it seem too daunting to people, but in science, miracles are happening all the time. On the central role of rich countries: I\u2019m a big believer in foreign aid, but the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they\u2019ll make it cheap enough for everyone else. But the big numbers are all in the developed economies, where China\u2019s defined into that term. On whether he\u2019s really read all 36 books by Vaclav Smil, his favorite author and a leading scholar of the history of energy use: I have read all of Smil. There\u2019s a book about the transition of the Japanese diet. I don\u2019t recommend it. On the limitations of a campaign to force university endowments and other funds to divest from fossil-fuel companies: If you think divestment alone is a solution, I worry you\u2019re taking whatever desire people have to solve this problem and kind of using up their idealism and energy on something that won\u2019t emit less carbon\u2014because only a few people in society are the owners of the equity of coal or oil companies. As long as there\u2019s no carbon tax and that stuff is legal, everybody should be able to drive around. So I\u2019ve been saying, \u201cHey, come on\u2014broaden your message to be pro\u2013R&D.\u201d And even the same people who are divesting those stocks of energy companies, ideally some of that money would come into this pool that is funding these high-risk innovations. And so that\u2019s a message that I\u2019ve started to get out. I don\u2019t know if that will be successful. On the surprising wisdom of government R&D: When I first got into this I thought, How well does the Department of Energy spend its R&D budget? And I was worried: Gosh, if I\u2019m going to be saying it should double its budget, if it turns out it\u2019s not very well spent, how am I going to feel about that? But as I\u2019ve really dug into it, the DARPA money is very well spent, and the basic-science money is very well spent. The government has these \u201cCenters of Excellence.\u201d They should have twice as many of those things, and those things should get about four times as much money as they do. Yes, the government will be somewhat inept\u2014but the private sector is in general inept. How many companies do venture capitalists invest in that go poorly? By far most of them. And it\u2019s just that every once in a while a Google or a Microsoft comes out, and some medium-scale successes too, and so the overall return is there, and so people keep giving them money. On why he thinks Congress may not be hopeless: The U.S. Congress does support solar and wind subsidies, which have been quite generous. So Congress isn\u2019t completely absent on this. The House actually passed a climate-change bill [in 2009], when it was a Democratic Congress. There\u2019s a class of voters who care about this, that I think both parties should want to compete for. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hopeless, because it\u2019s about American innovation, American jobs, American leadership, and there are examples where this has gone very, very well. On the centrality of government to progress on energy, historically: Everyone likes to argue about how much the shale-gas boom was driven by the private sector versus government; there was some of both. Nuclear: huge amount of government. Hydropower: mind-blowingly government\u2014because permitting those things, those big reservoirs and everything, you can\u2019t be a private-sector guy betting that you\u2019re going to get permitted. People think energy is more of a private-sector thing than it is. If you go back to Edison\u2019s time, there wasn\u2019t much government funding. There were rich people funding him. Since World War II, U.S.-government R&D has defined the state of the art in almost every area. But energy moves really slowly. There\u2019s this thing Vaclav Smil says: If Edison were reborn today, he would find our batteries completely understandable, because it\u2019s just chemistry. He would say, \u201cOh, cool, you found lithium, that was nice.\u201d Nuclear-power plants, he would go, \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d That, he would be impressed with. And chips, which we can use for managing data and stuff, he\u2019d be impressed with. But he could visit a coal plant and say, \u201cOkay, you scaled it up.\u201d He would visit a natural-gas plant and that would look pretty normal to him; he would look at an internal-combustion engine and he wouldn\u2019t be that surprised. On his faith in human ingenuity: If you told me that innovation had been frozen and we just have today\u2019s technologies, will the world run the climate-change experiment? You bet we will. We will not deny India coal plants; we will run the scary experiment of heating up the atmosphere and see what happens. The only reason I\u2019m optimistic about this problem is because of innovation. And innovation is a very uncertain process. For all I know, even if we don\u2019t up the R&D, 10 years from now some guy will invent something and it\u2019ll take care of this thing. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very likely, but nobody has a predictor function of innovation\u2014which is weird, because the whole modern economy and our lifestyles are an accumulation of innovations. So I want to tilt the odds in our favor by driving innovation at an unnaturally high pace, or more than its current business-as-usual course. I see that as the only thing. I want to call up India someday and say, \u201cHere\u2019s a source of energy that is cheaper than your coal plants, and by the way, from a global-pollution and local-pollution point of view, it\u2019s also better.\u201d I think if we don\u2019t get that in the next 15 years, then as much as people care about this thing, we will at least run the 2-degree experiment. Then there\u2019s the question of \u201cOkay, do we run the 3-degree experiment? Do we run the 4-degree experiment?\u201d      The San Francisco columbarium plays host to the remains and memories of thousands of the city's deceased residents. Legal experts said Monday's revelations show the special counsel is \u201cmaximizing the clout\u201d of the Russia investigation. Updated at 5:04 p.m.With the release of his first indictments and a surprise plea deal on Monday morning, Special Counsel Robert Mueller sketched a partial outline of his team\u2019s investigation into Russian electoral meddling and took control of a news narrative that had been increasingly dominated by his conservative critics. Legal experts said the court filings indicate Mueller is running a serious, deliberative, and far-sighted inquiry. \u201cI would say this is High-Level Special Counsel Investigation 101,\u201d said Richard Ben-Veniste, a member of the Watergate special-prosecutor task force. \u201cMueller is operating by the book.\u201d The first wave of charges came against two top Trump campaign officials, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates. Their indictment describes a conspiracy to evade taxes and launder at least $75 million of foreign income into the United States from offshore accounts. According to the special counsel\u2019s office, Manafort used the money to \u201cenjoy a lavish lifestyle\u201d by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on expensive suits, antique rugs, and other luxuries. Usually, laying low during controversies is a savvy move for legislators. But when it comes to Trump and Russia, it brings its own risks. \u201cSenator, I wonder if I could get a comment \u2026 \" Click. That little scene is being enacted in one form or another across Washington on Monday, following the indictments of three former Trump campaign officials. Reporters are seeking comment from Republican officeholders. Republican officeholders are desperately eluding reporters, conforming to the maxim often attributed to Calvin Coolidge, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain what you never said.\u201d Yet what is usually good advice can become, when it fails, spectacularly bad advice. Today is such a day. The advice I want to offer here is not directed to the brave senator or the principled senator. It is directed to the run-of-the-mill senator\u2014the prudent senator, the self-preserving senator. If you keep quiet today, you are putting yourself in jeopardy. Events are about to start moving very fast, and if you miss this moment, you will find yourself carried along by those events to places where it is not healthy for you to travel. Whatever else Monday\u2019s indictments revealed, they confirm that the president exercised extraordinarily poor judgment in staffing his campaign. Monday\u2019s double blockbuster from Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation\u2014indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and a plea deal with George Papadopoulos\u2014is at once an enormous advance in the story and highly unsatisfying. While these are important milestones in the probe, their import on the most interesting question, of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, is opaque. For the time being, however, there\u2019s one clear takeaway: Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, and George Papadopoulos should have never been anywhere near a major presidential campaign, and their hiring reinforces concerns about President Trump\u2019s judgment. Trump is not a policy expert, and although he occasionally boasted that he would learn what he needed on the job, his real sell to voters was that he would be an effective manager and dealmaker. For the details, he promised repeatedly, he would hire the best people. Instead, his campaign empowered a pair of aides who, according to prosecutors, were years into a $75 million money-laundering scheme, and named a foreign-policy aide with little experience who fancied himself a savvy global operator. The reasons why Manafort, Gates, and Papadopoulos were disastrously unwise picks were different, although they are all converging in the special counsel\u2019s investigation. After years of silence on his sexual orientation, Kevin Spacey issued a bizarre statement on \u201cchoosing to live as a gay man\u201d while apologizing for alleged child molestation. Late Sunday night, the comedian Billy Eichner wrote on Twitter, \u201cKevin Spacey has just invented something that has never existed before: a bad time to come out.\u201d After years of declining to talk about his sexual orientation, Spacey hurled it out in no uncertain terms as part of a public statement: \u201cI choose now to live as a gay man.\u201d Eyebrows may have been raised by the contentious phrasing\u2014the history of the idea of choice in sexual orientation being loaded. But many eyebrows were already fully raised by the fact that this sentence came after a half-apology for an alleged 1986 child molestation. The incident involved actor Anthony Rapp, then 14 years old. BuzzFeed published the allegation Sunday night, and Spacey\u2019s statement followed less than three hours later. He claimed no recollection of the evening in question, but wrote, \u201cI owe [Rapp] the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.\u201d More comfortable online than out partying, post-Millennials are safer, physically, than adolescents have ever been. But they\u2019re on the brink of a mental-health crisis. One day last summer, around noon, I called Athena, a 13-year-old who lives in Houston, Texas. She answered her phone\u2014she\u2019s had an iPhone since she was 11\u2014sounding as if she\u2019d just woken up. We chatted about her favorite songs and TV shows, and I asked her what she likes to do with her friends. \u201cWe go to the mall,\u201d she said. \u201cDo your parents drop you off?,\u201d I asked, recalling my own middle-school days, in the 1980s, when I\u2019d enjoy a few parent-free hours shopping with my friends. \u201cNo\u2014I go with my family,\u201d she replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll go with my mom and brothers and walk a little behind them. I just have to tell my mom where we\u2019re going. I have to check in every hour or every 30 minutes.\u201d Those mall trips are infrequent\u2014about once a month. More often, Athena and her friends spend time together on their phones, unchaperoned. Unlike the teens of my generation, who might have spent an evening tying up the family landline with gossip, they talk on Snapchat, the smartphone app that allows users to send pictures and videos that quickly disappear. They make sure to keep up their Snapstreaks, which show how many days in a row they have Snapchatted with each other. Sometimes they save screenshots of particularly ridiculous pictures of friends. \u201cIt\u2019s good blackmail,\u201d Athena said. (Because she\u2019s a minor, I\u2019m not using her real name.) She told me she\u2019d spent most of the summer hanging out alone in her room with her phone. That\u2019s just the way her generation is, she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice to know any life without iPads or iPhones. I think we like our phones more than we like actual people.\u201d Some people who have to be responsible for their siblings or parents as children grow up to be compulsive caretakers. Laura Kiesel was only 6 years old when she became a parent to her infant brother. At home, his crib was placed directly next to her bed, so that when he cried at night, she was the one to pick him up and sing him back to sleep. She says she was also in charge of changing his diapers and making sure he was fed every day. For the majority of her early childhood, she remembers, she tended to his needs while her own mother was in the depths of heroin addiction. From as early as she can remember, Kiesel says she had to take care of herself\u2014preparing her own meals, clothing herself, and keeping herself entertained. At school, she remembers becoming a morose and withdrawn child whose hair was often dirty and unkempt. George Papadopoulos heard that Russia had \"dirt\" related to Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands\" of hacked emails as early as April 2016. Updated at 4:54 p.m. ET Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election has notched its first guilty plea\u2014but the culprit isn\u2019t one of the bigger names in the case. George Papadopoulos, an obscure, low-level foreign-policy aide to the Donald Trump presidential campaign, pleaded guilty on October 5 to making false statements to the FBI. Papadopoulos doesn\u2019t have the same profile as Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chair whose indictment was unsealed on Monday, but the case against him offers new information about possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. According to a government filing, all of which Papadopoulos acknowledged to be accurate as part of the plea deal, he learned in March 2016 that he would be joining the Trump campaign as a foreign-policy adviser. Later that month, he met in Italy with an individual identified as \u201cthe Professor,\u201d who claimed to have extensive Russian government connections, and who took interest in his new job. The Professor in turn introduced Papadopoulos to a Russian woman who claimed to be a relative of Russian President Vladimir Putin, though Papadopoulos later learned she was not. Papadopoulos told Trump campaign officials about his contacts with the pair and received encouragement. Congressional testimony that illuminates what a developmental disability means\u2014and doesn\u2019t mean Last week, the actor, Special Olympian, and advocate Frank Stephens gave this testimony to Congress: \u201cI am a man with Down syndrome and my life is worth living.\u201d In fact, he went farther: \u201cI have a great life!\u201d For those conceived with his developmental disability, it is the best and worst of times. \u201cThe life expectancy for someone born with Down syndrome has increased from twenty-five in the early 1980s to more than fifty today,\u201d Caitrin Keiper writes in The New Atlantis. \u201cIn many other ways as well, a child born with Down syndrome today has brighter prospects than at any other point in history. Early intervention therapies, more inclusive educational support, legal protections in the workplace, and programs for assisted independent living offer a full, active future in the community.\u201d The prosecution of Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman and his associate Rick Gates could be the most significant prosecution under the Foreign Agents Registration Act ever. The indictment of Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates on Monday is, among many other things, the most significant prosecution of a Foreign Agents Registration Act violation ever. Manafort and Gates have been charged with a litany of federal crimes including conspiracy against the United States and tax fraud. They\u2019re also accused of having acted as agents of a foreign power\u2014in this case, the Ukrainian government under the pro-Russia former president Viktor Yanukovych\u2014without registering their activities with the Department of Justice, as is required by law under FARA. The DOJ\u2019s FARA unit is small, and the law is easy to skirt or violate and get away with it, and it\u2019s commonplace on K Street to do so. This is why the possibility that Manafort and Gates could go to prison for violating FARA \u00a0could have reverberations across the lobbying world. In the hypercompetitive world of higher education, many academics who face sexual harassment remain silent to avoid forfeiting a promotion or research gig. His career was too important. Despite allegations of sexual harassment that were substantiated by an internal investigation, the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law allowed Dean Sujit Choudhry to stay on the job. In 2015, Tyann Sorrell, Choudhry\u2019s assistant, described how the dean had pursued her for kisses and long hugs over a period of months. Choudhry initially held onto his professorship and benefits. Even after an uproar, the university, which boasts a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, kept him on payroll (he was pushed to resign as dean after Sorrell sued him for sexual harassment in 2016, but he remained on the law-school faculty). Choudhry was eventually put on a two-year sabbatical, still retaining travel funding and research grants (the settlement reached between Sorrell, Choudhry, and the school ensures that he will voluntarily resign in 2018).

            "content": "Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Robots are taking human jobs. But Bill Gates believes that governments should tax companies\u2019 use of them, as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment. It\u2019s a striking position from the world\u2019s richest man and a self-described techno-optimist who co-founded Microsoft, one of the leading players in artificial-intelligence technology. In a recent interview with Quartz, Gates said that a robot tax could finance jobs taking care of elderly people or working with kids in schools, for which needs are unmet and to which humans are particularly well suited. He argues that governments must oversee such programs rather than relying on businesses, in order to redirect the jobs to help people with lower incomes. The idea is not totally theoretical: EU lawmakers considered a proposal to tax robot owners to pay for training for workers who lose their jobs, though on Feb. 16 the legislators ultimately rejected it. \u201cYou ought to be willing to raise the tax level and even slow down the speed\u201d of automation, Gates argues. That\u2019s because the technology and business cases for replacing humans in a wide range of jobs are arriving simultaneously, and it\u2019s important to be able to manage that displacement. \u201cYou cross the threshold of job replacement of certain activities all sort of at once,\u201d Gates says, citing warehouse work and driving as some of the job categories that in the next 20 years will have robots doing them. You can watch Gates\u2019 remarks in the video above. Below is a transcript, lightly edited for style and clarity. Quartz: What do you think of a robot tax? This is the idea that in order to generate funds for training of workers, in areas such as manufacturing, who are displaced by automation, one concrete thing that governments could do is tax the installation of a robot in a factory, for example. Bill Gates: Certainly there will be taxes that relate to automation. Right now, the human worker who does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed and you get income tax, social security tax, all those things. If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you\u2019d think that we\u2019d tax the robot at a similar level. And what the world wants is to take this opportunity to make all the goods and services we have today, and free up labor, let us do a better job of reaching out to the elderly, having smaller class sizes, helping kids with special needs. You know, all of those are things where human empathy and understanding are still very, very unique. And we still deal with an immense shortage of people to help out there. So if you can take the labor that used to do the thing automation replaces, and financially and training-wise and fulfillment-wise have that person go off and do these other things, then you\u2019re net ahead. But you can\u2019t just give up that income tax, because that\u2019s part of how you\u2019ve been funding that level of human workers. And so you could introduce a tax on robots\u2026 There are many ways to take that extra productivity and generate more taxes. Exactly how you\u2019d do it, measure it, you know, it\u2019s interesting for people to start talking about now. Some of it can come on the profits that are generated by the labor-saving efficiency there. Some of it can come directly in some type of robot tax. I don\u2019t think the robot companies are going to be outraged that there might be a tax. It\u2019s OK. Could you figure out a way to do it that didn\u2019t dis-incentivize innovation? Well, at a time when people are saying that the arrival of that robot is a net loss because of displacement, you ought to be willing to raise the tax level and even slow down the speed of that adoption somewhat to figure out, \u201cOK, what about the communities where this has a particularly big impact? Which transition programs have worked and what type of funding do those require?\u201d You cross the threshold of job-replacement of certain activities all sort of at once. So, you know, warehouse work, driving, room cleanup, there\u2019s quite a few things that are meaningful job categories that, certainly in the next 20 years, being thoughtful about that extra supply is a net benefit. It\u2019s important to have the policies to go with that. People should be figuring it out. It is really bad if people overall have more fear about what innovation is going to do than they have enthusiasm. That means they won\u2019t shape it for the positive things it can do. And, you know, taxation is certainly a better way to handle it than just banning some elements of it. But [innovation] appears in many forms, like self-order at a restaurant\u2014what do you call that? There\u2019s a Silicon Valley machine that can make hamburgers without human hands\u2014seriously! No human hands touch the thing. [Laughs] And you\u2019re more on the side that government should play an active role rather than rely on businesses to figure this out? Well, business can\u2019t. If you want to do [something about] inequity, a lot of the excess labor is going to need to go help the people who have lower incomes. And so it means that you can amp up social services for old people and handicapped people and you can take the education sector and put more labor in there. Yes, some of it will go to, \u201cHey, we\u2019ll be richer and people will buy more things.\u201d But the inequity-solving part, absolutely government\u2019s got a big role to play there. The nice thing about taxation though, is that it really separates the issue: \u201cOK, so that gives you the resources, now how do you want to deploy it?\u201d",

Gates is founder, technology advisor and board member of Microsoft Corporation, the worldwide leader in software, services and solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential.\u00a0 He served as chairman of the board until Feb. 4, 2014. On June 27, 2008, Gates transitioned out of a day-to-day role in the company to spend more time on his global health and education work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He shares his thoughts about the foundation and other topics on Gates Notes, a website launched in January 2010. Gates continues to serve on Microsoft\u2019s Board of Directors and as an advisor on key development projects. Born on Oct. 28, 1955, Gates grew up in Seattle with his two sisters. Their father, William H. Gates II, is a Seattle attorney. Their late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way International. Gates attended public elementary school and the private Lakeside School. There, he discovered his interest in software and began programming computers at age 13. In 1973, Gates entered Harvard University as a freshman, where he lived down the hall from Steve Ballmer. While at Harvard, Gates developed a version of the programming language BASIC for the first microcomputer \u2013 the MITS Altair. In his junior year, Gates left Harvard to devote his energies to Microsoft, a company he had begun in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen. Guided by a belief that the computer would be a valuable tool on every office desktop and in every home, they began developing software for personal computers. Gates\u2019 foresight and his vision for personal computing have been central to the success of Microsoft and the software industry. Under Gates\u2019 leadership, Microsoft\u2019s mission has been to continually advance and improve software technology, and to make it easier, more cost-effective and more enjoyable for people to use computers. The company is committed to a long-term view, reflected in its industry-leading investment in research and development each year. In 1999, Gates wrote \u201cBusiness @ the Speed of Thought,\u201d a book that shows how computer technology can solve business problems in fundamentally new ways. The book was published in 25 languages and is available in more than 60 countries. \u201cBusiness @ the Speed of Thought\u201d has received wide critical acclaim, and was listed on the best-seller lists of the \u201cNew York Times,\u201d \u201cUSA Today,\u201d \u201cThe Wall Street Journal\u201d and on Amazon.com. Gates\u2019 previous book, \u201cThe Road Ahead,\u201d published in 1995, was at the top of the \u201cNew York Times\u201d bestseller list for seven weeks. Gates has donated the proceeds of both books to non-profit organizations that support the use of technology in education and skills development. In addition to his love of computers and software, Gates founded Corbis, which is developing one of the world\u2019s largest resources of visual information \u2013 a comprehensive digital archive of art and photography from public and private collections around the globe. He is also a member of the board of directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invests in companies engaged in diverse business activities. Philanthropy is very important to Gates.\u00a0 He and his wife, Melinda, started a foundation in 2000 to help reduce inequities in the United States and around the world.\u00a0 The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation supports philanthropic initiatives in the areas of global health and learning, with the hope that in the 21st century, advances in these critical areas will be available for all people.\u00a0 To learn more about the foundation, visit www.gatesfoundation.org Gates was married on Jan. 1, 1994, to Melinda French Gates. They have three children. Gates is an avid reader, and enjoys playing golf, tennis and bridge.                                                     web.jpg                                                                                                |                                                     print.jpg                                                                                                     web.jpg                                                                                                |                                                     print.jpg                                                                                                     web.jpg                                                                                                |                                                     print.jpg                                                                                                     web.jpg                                                                                                |                                                     print.jpg                                                 Follow us: Share this page:",

            "content": "William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, author, philanthropist, and co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation along with Paul Allen.[2][3] In 1975, Gates and Allen launched Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[4][a] Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself.[7] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[8] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[9] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[10] Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[11] Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000. Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[12] From 1995 to 2009, he held the title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years, and held it consistently from 2014\u2013July 2017, with an estimated net worth of US$89.9\u00a0billion as of October 2017.[1] However, on July 27, 2017, and since October 27, 2017, he has been surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, who has an estimated net worth of US$93.9\u00a0billion.[13] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[14] The foundation works to save lives and improve global health, and is working with Rotary International to eliminate polio.[15]   Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (b. 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929\u20131994). His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish.[16][17] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates's maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" because his father had the \"II\" suffix.[18] Early on in his life, Gates's parents had a law career in mind for him.[19] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[20][21][22] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that \"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing\".[23] At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school.[24] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.[25] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, \"There was just something neat about the machine.\"[26] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students\u00a0\u2013  Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans\u00a0\u2013  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[27][28] At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype. Subsequently, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with \"a disproportionate number of interesting girls.\"[29] He later stated that \"it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.\"[26] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[30] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.[31] Gates was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.[32] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[33][34] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[35] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO. He maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation from the company in 2014.[36] In his second year, Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[37] presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates's solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years;[37][38] its successor is faster by only one percent.[37] His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[39] While Gates was a student at Harvard,[40] he did not have a definite study plan, and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[41] The MITS Altair 8800 was released the following year. The new computer was based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[42] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much their son wanted to start his own company.[40] Gates explained his decision to leave Harvard, saying \"...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] leave [of absence].\"[43] After Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which demonstrated the Altair 8800, he contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[44] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,[45] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership \"Micro-Soft\" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.[45] Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name \"Microsoft\" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.[45] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies. Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 percent of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair \"hobby market\" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[46] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[45] The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979.[44] During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.[47][unreliable source?] IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating system for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[48] Big Blue first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[49] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.[50] Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.[50] They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[51] Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. PC Magazine asked if Gates were \"the man behind the machine?\",[48] and InfoWorld quoted an expert as stating \"it's Gates' computer\".[52] Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.[44] Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.[53] From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that \"Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.\"[54] Another executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates \"won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor.\"[55] Gates was an executive who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[56][57] He interrupted presentations with such comments as \"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\"[58] and \"Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?\"[59] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.[58] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, \"I'll do it over the weekend.\"[60][61][62] During Microsoft's early history, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[63] but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products.[61] He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, \"Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.\"[64] On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that over the next two years he would transition out of his day-to-day role to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[65] Many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates's approval. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as, \"compete\", \"concerned\", and \"we\". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[66] BusinessWeek reported: Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[67] Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, \"Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree.\"[68] Despite Gates's denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[68] In 2008, Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation.[69] As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a \"Yes\", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a \"Yes\". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about \"nothing\" (Seinfeld).[70] In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.[71] Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8\u00a0billion to US$78.5\u00a0billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates's assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[72] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside new CEO Satya Nadella.[10][73] Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: \"... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism.\" Gates also identified innovation as the \"real driver of progress\" and pronounced that \"America's way better today than it's ever been.\"[74] Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of superintelligence; in a Reddit \"ask me anything\", he stated that First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[75][76][77][78] In a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would \"highly recommend\" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[79] Gates's days are planned for him, similar to the US President's schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.[80] Gates married Melinda French on a golf course on the Hawaiian island of Lanai on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002). The family resides in a modern design mansion, which is an earth-sheltered house in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina near Seattle in Washington State, United States. According to 2007 King County public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125\u00a0million, and the annual property taxes are $991,000. The 66,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (6,100\u00a0m2) estate has a 60-foot (18\u00a0m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (230\u00a0m2) gym and a 1,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (93\u00a0m2) dining room.[81] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith: The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.[82] In the same interview, Gates said: \"I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm\u00a0\u2013 not all\u00a0\u2013 that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\"[82] The Codex Leicester is one of Gates's private acquisitions. He purchased the collection of famous scientific writings by Leonardo da Vinci for $30.8\u00a0million at an auction in 1994.[83] Gates is also known for being an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[84] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[85][86] In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101\u00a0billion.[87] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet.[88] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[89] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[90][91] Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014[92][93] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40\u00a0billion to more than US$82\u00a0billion.[94] Since October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.[13] Bill Gates has held the top spot on the list of The World's Billionaires for 18 out of the past 23 years.[95] Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.[96] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[97] In 2016, he was discussing his gaming habits when he revealed that he was color-blind.[98] In a BBC interview, Gates claimed \"I've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so... I've paid over $6 billion in taxes.\"[99] He is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich.[100] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[14] Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the \"William H. Gates Foundation.\" In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6\u00a0billion.[101][102] The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[103][104] Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[105] As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28\u00a0billion to charity;[106] the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.[107] The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[108] The foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat Vitamin A deficiency.[109] Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in The Power of Half.[110] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a commitment they called the \"Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge.\" The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.[111][112][113] Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20\u00a0million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[114] The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[115] Gates also donated $6\u00a0million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[116] On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).[117] Since about 2005, Bill Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the \"Reinvent the Toilet Challenge\", which has received considerable media interest.[118] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was \"produced from human feces\" in 2014\u00a0\u2013 in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni-processor.[119][120] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[121] Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10\u00a0million each as their inheritance. With only $30\u00a0million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.[122] In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell to the developing world.[123] In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[124] It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[125] The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students.[126] The scholarship program is administered by the United Negro College Fund.[127] In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when he decided to donate $50 million to UNAIDS through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[128][129] On April 29, 2017, Bill Gates partnered with Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer in playing a noncompetitive tennis match to a packed house at Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[130] Federer and Gates played against John Isner and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McReady. Gates and Federer won the game 6\u20134. In 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's 400 Richest People in America issue. He was worth $1.25\u00a0billion and was the world's youngest self-made billionaire.[12] Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes The World's Billionaires list and was the wealthiest from 1995 to 1996,[131] 1998 to 2007, 2009, and has been since 2014.[1] Gates was number one on Forbes' 400 Richest Americans list from 1993 through to 2007.[132][needs update] Time magazine named Gates one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th century, as well as one of the 100 most influential people of 2004, 2005, and 2006. Time also collectively named Gates, his wife Melinda and U2's lead singer Bono as the 2005 Persons of the Year for their humanitarian efforts.[133] In 2006, he was voted eighth in the list of \"Heroes of our time\".[134] Gates was listed in the Sunday Times power list in 1999, named CEO of the year by Chief Executive Officers magazine in 1994, ranked number one in the \"Top 50 Cyber Elite\" by Time in 1998, ranked number two in the Upside Elite 100 in 1999, and was included in The Guardian as one of the \"Top 100 influential people in media\" in 2001.[135] According to Forbes, Gates was ranked as the fourth most powerful person in the world in 2012,[136] up from fifth in 2011.[137] In 1994, he was honored as the twentieth Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society. In 1999, Gates received New York Institute of Technology's President's Medal.[138] Gates has received honorary doctorates from Nyenrode Business Universiteit, Breukelen, The Netherlands, in 2000;[139] the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2002;[140] Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2005; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in April 2007;[141] Harvard University in June 2007;[142] the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, in 2007,[143] and Cambridge University in June 2009.[144] He was also made an honorary trustee of Peking University in 2007.[145] Gates was made an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.[146] In November 2006, he was awarded the Placard of the Order of the Aztec Eagle, together with his wife Melinda who was awarded the Insignia of the same order, both for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in Mexico, and specifically in the program \"Un pa\u00eds de lectores\".[147] Gates received the 2010 Bower Award for Business Leadership from The Franklin Institute for his achievements at Microsoft and his philanthropic work.[148] Also in 2010, he was honored with the Silver Buffalo Award by the Boy Scouts of America, its highest award for adults, for his service to youth.[149] Entomologists named Bill Gates's flower fly, Eristalis gatesi, in his honor in 1997.[150] In 2002, Bill and Melinda Gates received the Jefferson Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged.[151] In 2006, Gates received the James C. Morgan Global Humanitarian Award from The Tech Awards.[152] In 2015, Gates, along with his wife Melinda, received the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian award for their social work in the country.[153][154] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Gates and his wife Melinda with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their philanthropic efforts.[155] In 2017, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande awarded Bill and Melinda with the France's highest national award \u2013 Legion of Honour in Paris for their charity efforts.[156] To date, Bill Gates has written two books: In 2013, Gates became a LinkedIn Influencer.[162] Gates was the guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on January 31, 2016, in which he talks about his relationships with his father and Steve Jobs, meeting his then future wife Melinda Ann French, the start of Microsoft and some of his habits (for example reading The Economist \"from cover to cover every week\"). His choice of things to take on a desert island were, for music: \"Blue Skies\" by Willie Nelson; book: The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker; and luxury item: a DVD Collection of Lectures from The Teaching Company.[163]",

            "content": "With $89 (\u00a367bn) billion in the bank, Microsoft founder Bill Gates\u00a0has been\u00a0the world's richest man\u00a0since May 2013.\u00a0 After founding and developing\u00a0one of the most powerful and profitable technology companies in history,\u00a0since 2008 he has\u00a0dedicated his life to charity work\u00a0via\u00a0The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, so far giving away\u00a0$31.1bn. William 'Bill' Henry Gates was born on 28 October 1955, and grew up in a comfortably-off family with his two sisters in Seattle, Washington.\u00a0His father, also called William, is a Seattle attorney and his late mother Mary was a schoolteacher. A deep-thinking child, Gates was educated at the private\u00a0Lakeside School in Seattle where he excelled at many subjects. It was here\u00a0in 1967\u00a0that he had his first encounter with a computer\u00a0and so began the many hours he would spend in the school computer room where,\u00a0he wrote his first computer program aged 13. Gates and his friend Paul Allen became so fascinated by computers that they built a programme based on an\u00a0Intel 8008 chip and used it to analyse traffic data for the Washington state highway department. Gates later won a place at\u00a0Harvard University but dropped out in 1975 to start Microsoft with Allen. In the mid-1970s, when typewriters and carbon paper were commonplace, Gates and\u00a0Allen had a far-fetched vision to have \"a computer on every desktop and in every home.\"\u00a0 Inspired by a magazine article about the world's first microcomputer, the pair started by developing a version of the programming language BASIC for the first microcomputer \u2013 the MITS Altair 8800. They approached MITS with their creation, and the company agreed to distribute it as 'Altair BASIC'. Allen was hired into MITS, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him in Albuquerque, New Mexico in November 1975. They officially established a small\u00a030-man operation called\u00a0\"Micro-Soft\" on 4 April 1975, with Gates as the CEO. Gates never returned to Harvard. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, but continued to develop programming language software for various systems. The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington, on 1 January 1979. During Microsoft's early years, Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit. IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 to provide the operating system for its upcoming personal computer. For this deal, Microsoft bought a system called 86-DOS from a company called Seattle Computer Products and, after adapting it for the PC, delivered it to IBM as 'PC DOS' in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000. However, Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware companies would clone IBM's system. He was right, and the sales of PC DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry. Despite IBM's name on the operating system, Gates was quickly identified as 'the man behind the machine'.\u00a0\u00a0Microsoft's sales subsequently soared from $7 million in 1980 to $16 million in 1981.\u00a0 Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring in June 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates president of Microsoft and the chairman of the board. By this time he had gained a reputation for being distant to others. He met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers, and was reportedly verbally pugnacious, berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies that placed the company's long-term interests at risk. Microsoft launched the first version of its Windows 1.0 operating system in\u00a01985, but critics dubbed it slow and cumbersome. Further problems came when growing rival Apple saw Windows as a rip-off of its much-easier-to-use\u00a0Macintosh operating system and sued - although the courts finally ruled in Microsoft's favour in the mid-1990s. Microsoft moved its headquarters to Redmond in February 1986, and on March 13 the company went public with huge success, turning Gates into one of the wealthiest people in the U.S. In 1987 Gates, aged 31, had become\u00a0the world's youngest billionnaire. As the years rolled on, Gates worked hard to improve Windows and also introduced the top-selling Office suite, which bundled applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. Gates also managed to persuade key computer makers to preload Microsoft's software on every computer it sold. \u00a0By 1993, Windows was estimated to be\u00a0running on almost 85 per cent of the world's computers.\u00a0 Perhaps Gates' biggest regret will be failing to translate Microsoft\u2019s dominance of the desktop to the web. In 1995, Gates wrote a call-to-arms memo to his employees, entitled \u201cThe internet tidal wave\u201d, which claimed that the web was \u201cthe single most important development to come along since the IBM PC.\u201d Microsoft, though, was slow to see the potential of building its own search engine\u00a0and relied on search partners\u00a0such as Inktomi\u00a0for several years. By the time it did launch its own dedicated search platform, it had lost significant ground to Google, not just in the search and advertising space, but also the desktop space. Google offered a host of free online programs, such as Google Docs, that competed directly with the paid-for Office suite. \u201cGoogle kicked our butts,\u201d said Gates in a 2005 interview, when he also branded Microsoft\u2019s decision not to pursue a dedicated search engine from the outset as \u201cstupid as hell\u201d. Microsoft, arguably, is still on the back foot. It wasn't all bad news though. 1995 was the year that Microsoft launched its groundbreaking Windows 1995\u00a0operating system. As well as being a technological breakthrough it was an unprecedented cultural phenomenon, and\u00a0its\u00a0launch became a massive celebrity-backed global event.\u00a0 Features included\u00a0the Start Menu\u00a0and the taskbar, which\u00a0still define Microsoft\u2019s operating system today. The software was also a leap forward in graphic design and was released as home computers were becoming ever more affordable. The launch put Microsoft at the forefront of the home computing revolution and in 1998 it became the world's biggest company.\u00a0 Gates handed over the CEO position of Microsoft in 2000\u00a0to Steve Ballmer, an old college friend and employee of the company since 1980. Allen resigned after a long-term illness, while Gates became 'chief software architect' and chairman of the board. Microsoft went on to release Windows XP in 2001, followed by Windows Vista in 2007, Windows 7 in 2009 and Windows 8 in 2011. It entered the game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo, launching the first Xbox in 2001, and began to take on Apple in the smartphone market with the launch of Windows Phone in 2011, and the purchase of Nokia in 2013. Meanwhile, Gates announced in June 2006 that he would begin transitioning out of his day-to-day role to dedicate more time to philanthropy.\u00a0He finally retired as chief software architect in June 2008, and stepped down as chairman in 2014. He met Melinda French,\u00a0a young woman working at Microsoft, in 1989 and married her in 1994. The couple have three children; Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe.\u00a0 Officially established in 2000, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\u00a0is the largest philanthropic organisation in the world and has been the Gates' main focus since he cut back his role at Microsoft in 2008.\u00a0 As well as funding\u00a0global health\u00a0programmes dedicated to disease prevention, immunisation and vaccination, it also aims to\u00a0reduce extreme poverty, expand educational opportunities and improve access to information technology. In recent years\u00a0Gates has also turned his attention to the environment. In 2006, Warren Buffet donated\u00a0$31 billion, most of his fortune, to the foundation. In 2013, as part of Gates'\u00a0$5.5 billion effort to eradicate polio by 2018,\u00a0India\u00a0was certified polio-free by the World Health Organisation, leaving only three countries that have never been free of the disease. Gates and his wife plan to eventually donate 95 per cent of their wealth to charity. \u00a9 Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017 We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.

In a filing to the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, Gates revealed he\u2019s donating 64 million shares of Microsoft worth a total of $4.6 billion. It\u2019s a huge donation, and Bloomberg reports that it\u2019s the biggest since he gave away $16 billion worth in 1999 and $5.1 billion of shares in 2000. The SEC filing doesn\u2019t reveal exactly where Bill Gates has donated his Microsoft shares to, but Gates has been on a mission to gift his shares and fund the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a charity set up by him and his wife for their philanthropy. Gates usually donates around 80 million Microsoft shares each year, and this latest gift means he\u2019s left with nearly 103 million shares. The SEC filing also reveals that Melinda Gates holds nearly 425,000 Microsoft shares.  If Gates continues to gift shares like he has in the past, then he could reduce his stake in Microsoft to zero in 2019. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is still the largest holder of Microsoft stock, followed by Gates and then current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.  While the donation is a large amount in monetary terms, Gates still holds the title of richest person in the world. Bloomberg now values Gates at $86.1 billion, down from his previous $90 billion fortune. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is edging closer, though. The billionaire briefly surpassed Gates last month to become the world\u2019s richest person, before falling back behind Gates after Amazon\u2019s share price dropped.

            "content": "Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates (born October 28, 1955) and his partner Paul Allen founded and built the world&apos;s largest software business, Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Gates announced that he was stepping down as Microsoft&apos;s chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In March 1986, Bill Gates took Microsoft public with an initial public offering (IPO) of $21 per share, making him an instant millionaire at age 31. Gates held 45 percent of the company&apos;s 24.7 million shares, making his stake at that time $234 million of Microsoft&apos;s $520 million.\u00a0 Over time, the company&apos;s stock increased in value and split numerous times. In 1987, Bill Gates became a billionaire when the stock hit $90.75 a share. Since then, Gates has been at the top, or at least near the top, of Forbes&apos; annual list of the top 400 wealthiest people in America. In 1999, with stock prices at an all-time high and the stock splitting eight-fold since its IPO, Gates&apos; wealth briefly topped $101 billion. In 1997, Gates and his family moved into a 55,000-square-foot, $54-million house on the shore of Lake Washington. Though the house serves as a business center, it is said to be very cozy for the couple and their three children.\u00a0 In 1987, a 23-year-old Microsoft product manager named Melinda French caught the eye of Bill Gates, then 32. The very bright and organized Melinda was a perfect match for Gates. In time, their relationship grew as they discovered an intimate and intellectual connection. On January 1, 1994, Melinda and Bill were married in Hawaii.\u00a0 Following the devastating death of his mother to breast cancer just a few months after their wedding, Bill and Melinda took some time off in 1995 to travel and get a new perspective on life and the world. In 1996, their first daughter, Jennifer, was born. Their son, Rory, was born in 1999, and a second daughter, Phoebe, arrived in 2002. READ ARTICLE: 7 Fun Facts About Bill Gates. In 1994, Bill and Melinda Gates established the William H. Gates Foundation, which was dedicated to supporting education, world health and investment in low-income communities. With Melinda&apos;s influence, Bill had taken an interest in becoming a civic leader in the footsteps of his mother, studying the philanthropic work of American industrial titans Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. He realized that he had an obligation to give more of his wealth to charity. In 2000, the couple combined several family foundations and made a $28 billion contribution to form the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2000, Bill Gates stepped down from the day-to-day operations of Microsoft, turning over the job of CEO to college friend Steve Ballmer, who had been with Microsoft since 1980. He positioned himself as chief software architect so he could concentrate on what was for him the more passionate side of the business, though he remained chairman of the board.\u00a0 Over the next few years, Bill\u2019s involvement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation occupied much of his time and even more of his interest. In 2006, Gates announced he was transitioning himself from full-time work at Microsoft to devote more quality time to the foundation. His last full day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. In February 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in order to move into a new position as technology adviser; longtime Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was replaced by 46-year-old Satya Nadella. Gates continues to devote much of his time and energy to the work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The organization tackles international and domestic issues, such as health and education and helping students in the United States become college-ready. In 2015, Gates spoke out in favor of national Common Core standards in grades K through 12 and charter schools. Gates also proved to be a groundbreaking employer when, around this time, the foundation announced that it would give its employees a year&apos;s paid leave after the birth or the adoption of a child.\u00a0 Bill Gates was born William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington.\u00a0 Bill Gates grew up in an upper middle-class family with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their father, William H. Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law student when he met his future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an athletic, outgoing student at the University of Washington, actively involved in student affairs and leadership. The Gates family atmosphere was warm and close, and all three children were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence. Bill showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family athletic games at their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished in playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled at Monopoly.\u00a0 Bill had a very close relationship with his mother, Mary, who after a brief career as a teacher devoted her time to helping raise the children and working on civic affairs and with charities. She also served on several corporate boards, including those of the First Interstate Bank in Seattle (founded by her grandfather), the United Way and International Business Machines (IBM). She would often take Bill along when she volunteered in schools and at community organizations. Bill was a voracious reader as a child, spending many hours poring over reference books such as the encyclopedia. Around the age of 11 or 12, Bill&apos;s parents began to have concerns about his behavior. He was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times, and his parents worried he might become a loner. Though they were strong believers in public education, when Bill turned 13, they enrolled him at Seattle&apos;s exclusive preparatory Lakeside School. He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, excelling in math and science, but also doing very well in drama and English. While at Lakeside School, a Seattle computer company offered to provide computer time for the students. The Mother&apos;s Club used proceeds from the school&apos;s rummage sale to purchase a teletype terminal for students to use. Bill Gates became entranced with what a computer could do and spent much of his free time working on the terminal. He wrote a tic-tac-toe program in BASIC computer language that allowed users to play against the computer. Gates graduated from Lakeside in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the college SAT test, a feat of intellectual achievement that for several years he boasted about when introducing himself to new people. Gates enrolled at Harvard University in the fall of 1973, originally thinking of a career in law. But his freshman year saw him spend more of his time in the computer lab than in class. Gates did not really have a study regimen. Instead, he could get by on a few hours of sleep, cram for a test, and pass with a reasonable grade. Much to his parents&apos; dismay, within two years Gates dropped out of college in 1975 to pursue his business, Microsoft, with partner Paul Allen. At Lakeside School Gates met Paul Allen, who was two years his senior. The pair became fast friends, bonding over their common enthusiasm for computers, even though they were very different people. Allen was more reserved and shy. Bill was feisty and at times combative. Regardless of their differences, they both spent much of their free time together working on programs. Occasionally, the two disagreed and would clash over who was right or who should run the computer lab. On one occasion, their argument escalated to the point where Allen banned Gates from the computer lab.\u00a0 At one point, Gates and Allen had their school computer privileges revoked for taking advantage of software glitches to obtain free computer time from the company that provided the computers. After their probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to debug the program. During this time, Gates developed a payroll program for the computer company the boys hacked into and a scheduling program for the school. In 1970, at the age of 15, Bill Gates and Paul Allen went into business together, developing \"Traf-o-Data,\" a computer program that monitored traffic patterns in Seattle. They netted $20,000 for their efforts. Gates and Allen wanted to start their own company, but Gates&apos; parents wanted him to finish school and go on to college, where they hoped he would work to become a lawyer. Allen went to Washington State University, while Gates went to Harvard, though the pair stayed in touch. After attending college for two years, Allen dropped out and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to work for Honeywell. Around this time, he showed Gates an edition of Popular Electronics magazine featuring an article on the Altair 8800 mini-computer kit. Both boys were fascinated with the possibilities of what this computer could create in the world of personal computing.\u00a0 The Altair was made by a small company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). Gates and Allen contacted the company, proclaiming that they were working on a BASIC software program that would run the Altair computer. In reality, they didn&apos;t have an Altair to work with or the code to run it, but they wanted to know if MITS was interested in someone developing such software.\u00a0 MITS was, and its president, Ed Roberts, asked the boys for a demonstration. Gates and Allen scrambled, spending the next two months writing the software at Harvard&apos;s computer lab. Allen traveled to Albuquerque for a test run at MITS, never having tried it out on an Altair computer. It worked perfectly. Allen was hired at MITS, and Gates soon left Harvard to work with him. Together they founded Microsoft.\u00a0 Paul Allen remained with Microsoft until 1983, when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin&apos;s disease. Though his cancer went into remission a year later with intensive treatment, Allen resigned from the company. Rumors abound as to why Allen left Microsoft. Some say Bill Gates pushed him out, but many say it was a life-changing experience for Allen and he saw there were other opportunities that he could invest his time in. In 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen formed Micro-Soft, a blend of \"micro-computer\" and \"software\" (they dropped the hyphen to Microsoft within a year). Although the company started out on shaky footing, by 1979 Microsoft was grossing approximately $2.5 million, and, at the age of 23, Gates placed himself as the head of the company. With his acumen for software development and a keen business sense, he led the company and worked as its spokesperson. Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, often rewriting code himself when he saw it necessary.\u00a0 Following the development of software for IBM, between 1979 and 1981 Microsoft&apos;s growth exploded. Staff increased from 25 to 128, and revenue shot up from $2.5 million to $16 million. In mid-1981, Gates and Allen incorporated Microsoft, and Gates was appointed president and chairman of the board. Allen was named executive vice president. At first, all was not smooth sailing. Although Microsoft\u2019s BASIC software program for the Altair computer netted the company a fee and royalties, it wasn&apos;t meeting their overhead. According to Gates&apos; later account, only about 10 percent of the people using BASIC in the Altair computer had actually paid for it. Microsoft&apos;s BASIC software was popular with computer hobbyists, who obtained pre-market copies and were reproducing and distributing them for free. At this time, much of the personal computer enthusiasts were people not in it for the money. They felt the ease of reproduction and distribution allowed them to share software with friends and fellow computer enthusiasts. Bill Gates thought differently. He saw the free distribution of software as stealing, especially when it involved software that was created to be sold. In February 1976, Gates wrote an open letter to computer hobbyists, saying that continued distribution and use of software without paying for it would \"prevent good software from being written.\" In essence, pirating software would discourage developers from investing time and money into creating quality software. The letter was unpopular with computer enthusiasts, but Gates stuck to his beliefs and would use the threat of innovation as a defense when faced with charges of unfair business practices. Gates had an acrimonious relationship with MITS president Ed Roberts, often resulting in shouting matches. The combative Gates clashed with Roberts on software development and the direction of the business. Roberts considered Gates spoiled and obnoxious. In 1977, Roberts sold MITS to another computer company and went back to Georgia to enter medical school and become a doctor.\u00a0 Gates and Allen were on their own. The pair had to sue the new owner of MITS to retain the software rights they had developed for Altair. Microsoft wrote software in different formats for other computer companies, and, at the beginning of 1979, Gates moved the company&apos;s operations to Bellevue, Washington, just east of Seattle. Gates was glad to be home again in the Pacific Northwest, and threw himself into his work. All 25 employees of the young company had broad responsibilities for all aspects of the operation, product development, business development and marketing.\u00a0 As the computer industry began to grow, with companies like Apple, Intel and IBM developing hardware and components, Bill was continuously out on the road touting the merits of Microsoft software applications. He often took his mother with him. Mary was highly respected and well connected with her membership on several corporate boards, including IBM&apos;s. It was through Mary that Bill Gates met the CEO of IBM. In November 1980, IBM was looking for software that would operate their upcoming personal computer (PC) and approached Microsoft. Legend has it that at the first meeting with Bill Gates someone at IBM mistook him for an office assistant and asked him to serve coffee.\u00a0 Gates did look very young, but he quickly impressed IBM, convincing them that he and his company could meet their needs. The only problem was that Microsoft had not developed the basic operating system that would run IBM&apos;s new computers. Not to be stopped, Gates bought an operating system that was developed to run on computers similar to IBM&apos;s PC. He made a deal with the software&apos;s developer, making Microsoft the exclusive licensing agent and later full owner of the software but not telling them of the IBM deal. The company later sued Microsoft and Gates for withholding important information. Microsoft settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, but neither Gates nor Microsoft admitted to any wrongdoing. Gates had to adapt the newly purchased software to work for the IBM PC. He delivered it for a $50,000 fee, the same price he had paid for the software in its original form. IBM wanted to buy the source code, which would have given them the information to the operating system. Gates refused, instead proposing that IBM pay a licensing fee for copies of the software sold with their computers. Doing this allowed Microsoft to license the software they called MS-DOS to any other PC manufacturer, should other computer companies clone the IBM PC, which they soon did. Microsoft also released software called Softcard, which allowed Microsoft BASIC to operate on Apple II machines. By 1983, Microsoft was going global with offices in Great Britain and Japan, and with 30 percent of the world&apos;s computers running on its software.\u00a0 Though their rivalry is legend, Microsoft and Apple shared many of their early innovations. In 1981, Apple, at the time led by Steve Jobs, invited Microsoft to help develop software for Macintosh computers. Some developers were involved in both Microsoft development and the development of Microsoft applications for Macintosh. The collaboration could be seen in some shared names between the Microsoft and Macintosh systems.\u00a0 It was through this knowledge sharing that Microsoft was to develop Windows, a system that used a mouse to drive a graphic interface, displaying text and images on the screen. This differed greatly from the text-and-keyboard driven MS-DOS system where all text formatting showed on the screen as code and not what actually would be printed. Bill Gates quickly recognized the threat this kind of software might pose for MS-DOS and Microsoft overall. For the unsophisticated user\u2014which was most of the buying public\u2014the graphic imagery of the competing VisiCorp software used in a Macintosh system would be so much easier to use.\u00a0 Gates announced in an advertising campaign that a new Microsoft operating system was about to be developed that would use a graphic interface. It was to be called \"Windows,\" and would be compatible with all PC software products developed on the MS-DOS system. The announcement was a bluff, in that Microsoft had no such program under development. But as a marketing tactic it was sheer genius, as nearly 30 percent of the computer market was using the MS-DOS system and would wait for Windows software rather than change to a new system. Without people willing to change formats, software developers were unwilling to write programs for the VisiCorp system and it lost momentum by early 1985. In November 1985, nearly two years after his announcement, Bill Gates and Microsoft launched Windows. Visually the Windows system looked very similar to the Macintosh system Apple Computer Corporation had introduced nearly two years earlier. Apple had earlier given Microsoft full access to their technology while it was working on making Microsoft products compatible for Apple computers. Gates had advised Apple to license their software but they ignored the advice, being more interested in selling computers.\u00a0 Once again, Gates took full advantage of the situation and created a software format that was strikingly similar to the Macintosh. Apple threatened to sue, and Microsoft retaliated, saying it would delay shipment of its Microsoft-compatible software for Macintosh users. In the end, Microsoft prevailed in the courts because it could prove that while there were similarities in how the two software systems operated, each individual function was distinctly different. Bill Gates&apos; intelligence allowed him to be able to see all sides of the software industry\u2014product development and corporate strategy. When analyzing any corporate move, he would develop a profile of all the possible cases and run through them, asking questions about anything that could possibly happen.\u00a0 Despite the success of Microsoft, Bill Gates never felt totally secure. Always looking over his shoulder to check on the competition, Gates developed a white-hot drive and competitive spirit. Gates expected everyone in the company to have the same dedication. Gates&apos; assistant reported coming to work early to find someone sleeping under a desk. She considered calling security or the police, until she discovered it was Gates. His confrontational management style also became legend, as he would challenge employees and their ideas to keep the creative process going. An unprepared presenter could hear, \"That&apos;s the stupidest thing I&apos;ve ever heard!\" from Gates. But this was as much a test of the rigor of the employee as it was Gates&apos; passion for his company. He was constantly checking the people around him to see if they were really convinced of their ideas. Outside the company, Bill Gates was gaining a reputation as a ruthless competitor. Several tech companies, led by IBM, began to develop their own operating system, called OS/2, to replace MS-DOS. Rather than give in to the pressure, Gates pushed ahead with the Windows software, improving its operation and expanding its uses. In 1989, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Office, which bundled office productivity applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel into one system that was compatible with all Microsoft products. The applications were not as easily compatible with OS/2. Microsoft&apos;s new version of Windows sold 100,000 copies in just two weeks, and OS/2 soon faded away. This left Microsoft with a virtual monopoly on operating systems for PCs. Soon the Federal Trade Commission began to investigate Microsoft for unfair marketing practices. Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft faced a string of Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department investigations. Some related allegations that Microsoft made unfair deals with computer manufacturers who installed the Windows operating system on their computers. Other charges involved Microsoft forcing computer manufactures to sell Microsoft&apos;s Internet Explorer as a condition for selling the Windows operating system with their computers. At one point, Microsoft faced a possible break up of its two divisions\u2014operating systems and software development. Microsoft defended itself, harking back to Bill Gates&apos; earlier battles with software piracy and proclaiming that such restrictions were a threat to innovation. Eventually, Microsoft was able to find a settlement with the federal government to avoid a breakup.\u00a0 Through it all, Gates found some inventive ways to deflect the pressure with lighthearted commercials and public appearances at computer trade shows during which he posed as Star Trek&apos;s Mr. Spock. Gates continued to run the company and weather the federal investigations through the 1990s. In addition to being one of the richest and most successful businessmen in the history of the world, Bill Gates has also received numerous awards for philanthropic work. Time magazine named Gates one of the most influential people of the 20th century. The magazine also named Gates and his wife Melinda, along with rock band U2&apos;s lead singer, Bono, as the 2005 Persons of the Year. Gates holds several honorary doctorates from universities throughout the world. He was knighted as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.\u00a0 In 2006, Gates and his wife were awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle by the Mexican government for their philanthropic work throughout the world in the areas of health and education. In 2016, Gates and his wife Melinda were recognized for their philanthropic work when they were named recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.

He remains the world's richest person, despite giving away 64 million shares in Microsoft. The shares are equivalent to 5% of his total fortune, currently estimated to be $89.9bn. Since 1994 Mr Gates, 61, and his wife Melinda have given away a total of $35bn in cash and stocks to a range of charitable causes. The donation was made in June but became public on Monday following the filing of a document with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Gates' share in Microsoft is now just 1.3%. Prior to this, Mr Gates gave away $16bn in Microsoft shares in 1999 and $5.1bn in 2000.  The majority of all previous donations have been made to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is primarily focused on reducing world poverty, combating infectious diseases and providing universal access to computers. It is not known who the recipient of this latest donation is, however when federal documents are filed, it usually means new money is being given to a foundation, the Chronicle of Philanthropy reports.   In 2010, Mr and Mrs Gates and the well-known investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett created the Giving Pledge, and as of May 2017, 158 individuals or couples have agreed to contribute at least half of their wealth to charity.  This latest donation is the biggest charitable gift to have been made anywhere in the world so far this year. The second largest was made by Mr Buffett, who donated almost $3.2bn to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation last month. And the third biggest came from Dell Computer Corporation founder Michael Dell and his wife Susan.  In May the couple gave more than $1bn to their foundation, which focuses on children's issues and community initiatives.

In 1986, when the company went public, Gates held 45% (pdf) of its shares; in 1996, his stake had nearly halved to 24%; and now, with his latest 64-million-share donation, he\u2019s down to a mere 1.3%, according to Bloomberg. (On the other hand, his 45% in 1986 was worth $350 million, and his 1.3% today is worth around $7.3 billion.) The trend is in large part due to Bill and Melinda Gates\u2019 philanthropic activities. In 2010, they established the Giving Pledge along with fellow billionaire Warren Buffett to commit the majority of their wealth to charity. And since 1994, Bloomberg reports, the couple has gifted roughly $35 billion in stocks and cash. But Gates hasn\u2019t only been donating shares to charity. SEC filings show that between his gift-giving, Gates has been gradually selling off shares for at least the last four years (as far back as SEC\u2019s full-text search database goes). Before giving a large gift of 31 million shares in November of 2014, he was selling roughly 100 million shares per year. After that gift, the annual rate dropped to around 57 million. At this rate, with a little over 100 million shares left to his name, according to his last SEC filing, the tech mogul will have no more stock in his company by the middle of 2019.",

            "content": "President of the United StatesIncumbent Presidency Appointments Policy positions International trips Business and personal Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current President of the United States, in office since January 20, 2017. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality. Trump was born in the New York City borough of Queens. He earned an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. A third-generation businessman, Trump followed in the footsteps of his grandmother Elizabeth and father Fred in running the family real estate company. He served as chairman and president of The Trump Organization from 1971 until his inauguration as president in January 2017, when he delegated company management to his sons Donald Jr. and Eric. Trump's business career primarily focused on building or renovating office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump also started several side ventures and branded various products with his name. He has written or co-authored several books (including The Art of the Deal), and he produced and hosted The Apprentice television series for 12 years. As of 2017[update], he was the 544th richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $3.5\u00a0billion. Trump had long expressed interest in politics. He entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. His campaign received extensive free media coverage; many of his public statements were controversial or false. Trump won the general election on November 8, 2016, in a surprise victory against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election despite losing the popular vote. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. In domestic policy, Trump has sought, so far without success, to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He appointed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; the ban was partially implemented after legal challenges. In foreign policy, he withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Agreement, undid parts of the Cuban Thaw, and asked Muslim leaders to drive out extremists from their countries at the 2017 Riyadh summit. After Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, the Justice Department appointed a special counsel to continue the investigation into potential links between Russia and Trump campaign associates, and any related matters. Trump's ancestors originated from the German village of Kallstadt, Palatinate, on his father's side, and from the Outer Hebrides isles of Scotland on his mother's side. All his grandparents, and his mother, were born in Europe. His mother's grandfather was also christened \"Donald\".[2] Trump's paternal grandfather, Friedrich Trump, first emigrated to the United States in 1885 at the age of 16, and became a citizen in 1892. He amassed a fortune operating boom-town restaurants and boarding houses in the Seattle area and the Klondike region of Canada during the gold rush.[3] On a visit to Kallstadt, he met Elisabeth Christ and married her in 1902. The couple settled in New York permanently in 1905.[4] Frederick died from influenza during the 1918 pandemic.[5] Donald's father, Fred Trump, was born in 1905 in the Bronx. Fred started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15, shortly after his father's death. Their company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, was primarily active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. Fred eventually built and sold thousands of houses, barracks and apartments.[5][6] The company would later become The Trump Organization after Donald Trump took over in 1971.[7] Donald's mother, Mary Anne, was born in Tong, Lewis, Scotland. At age 18 in 1930, she emigrated to New York, where she worked as a maid.[8] Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens.[8][9] Donald's uncle John Trump was an electrical engineer, physicist, and inventor. He was also a professor at MIT from 1936 to 1973. During World War II, he was involved in radar research for the Allies and helped design X-ray machines that were used to treat cancer.[10] Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Queens, New York City. He was the fourth of five children born to Frederick Trump (1905\u20131999) and Mary Anne Trump (n\u00e9e MacLeod, 1912\u20132000).[13] His siblings are Maryanne (b. 1937), Fred Jr. (1938\u20131981), Elizabeth (b. 1942), and Robert (b. 1948). Trump grew up in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens. He attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade. At age 13, he enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, after his parents discovered that he had made frequent trips into Manhattan without their permission.[14][15] In August 1964, Trump began his higher education at Fordham University.[11][16] After two years, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, because it offered one of the few real-estate studies departments in United States academia at the time.[16][17] In addition to his father, Trump was inspired by Manhattan developer William Zeckendorf, vowing to be \"even bigger and better\".[18] While at Wharton, he worked at the family business, Elizabeth Trump and Son,[19] graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.[16][20][21] Trump was not drafted during the Vietnam War, and he did not enlist either as a volunteer or as a Reserve Officer Training Corps candidate.[22] While Trump was in college from 1964 to 1968, he obtained four student deferments.[23] In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a military medical examination, and in 1968 was briefly classified as fit by a local draft board. In September of that year, he was given a medical deferment, which he later attributed to heel spurs.[24] In 1969, he received a high number in the draft lottery, which gave him a low probability to be called to military service.[24][25][26] Trump has five children by three marriages, as well as nine grandchildren.[27][28] His first two marriages ended in widely publicized divorces.[29] Trump was 30 years old when he married his first wife, Czech model Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1, on April 7, 1977, at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan in a ceremony performed by the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale.[30][31] They had three children: son Donald Jr. (b. 1977), daughter Ivanka (b. 1981), and son Eric (b. 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[32] The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.[33] In October 1993, Maples gave birth to Trump's daughter, who was named Tiffany after high-end retailer Tiffany & Company.[34] Maples and Trump were married two months later on December 20, 1993.[35] They divorced in 1999,[36] and Tiffany was raised by Marla in California.[37] On January 22, 2005, Trump married his third wife, Slovenian model Melania Knauss, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida. The ceremony was followed by a reception at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.[38] In 2006, Melania acquired United States citizenship[39] and on March 20 of that year, she gave birth to a son whom they named Barron.[40][41] Melania became First Lady of the United States upon Trump's inauguration as the nation's 45th president in January 2017.[42] Upon his inauguration as president, Trump delegated the management of his real estate business to his two adult sons, Eric and Don Jr.[43] His daughter Ivanka resigned from The Trump Organization and moved to Washington with her husband Jared Kushner. She serves as an assistant to the president,[44] and he is a Senior Advisor in the White House.[45] Trump's elder sister, Maryanne Barry, is an inactive Federal Appeals Court judge on the Third Circuit.[46] Trump's ancestors were Lutheran on his father's side in Germany[47] and Presbyterian on his mother's side in Scotland.[48] His parents married in a Manhattan Presbyterian church in 1936.[49] As a child, he attended the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, and had his Confirmation there.[31] In the 1970s, his family joined the Marble Collegiate Church (an affiliate of the Reformed Church in America) in Manhattan.[50] The pastor at that church, Norman Vincent Peale, author of The Power of Positive Thinking and The Art of Living, ministered to Trump's family and mentored him until Peale's death in 1993.[51][50] Trump, who is Presbyterian,[52][53] has cited Peale and his works during interviews when asked about the role of religion in his personal life.[50] Trump receives Holy Communion, but he has said that he does not ask God for forgiveness. He stated: \"I think if I do something wrong, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture.\"[54] On the campaign trail, Trump has referred to The Art of the Deal as his second favorite book after the Bible, saying, \"Nothing beats the Bible.\"[55] In a 2016 speech to Liberty University, he referred to \"2 Corinthians\" (pronounced \"Second Corinthians\") as \"Two Corinthians\", eliciting chuckles from the audience.[56][57] The New York Times reported that Evangelical Christians nationwide thought \"that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure\".[58] Trump has had associations with a number of Christian spiritual leaders, including Florida pastor Paula White, who has been called his \"closest spiritual confidant.\"[59] In 2015, he received a blessing from Greek Orthodox priest Emmanuel Lemelson[60] and in 2016, he released a list of his religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed and others.[61] Referring to his daughter Ivanka's conversion to Judaism before her marriage to Jared Kushner, Trump said: \"I have a Jewish daughter; and I am very honored by that.\"[62] Trump's physician, Harold Bornstein, issued a 2016 medical report that showed Trump's blood pressure and liver and thyroid function to be in normal ranges.[63][64] He is overweight and takes statins to lower his cholesterol.[64] Trump has said that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed drugs, including marijuana.[65] He also drinks no alcohol; this decision arose in part from watching his older brother Fred Jr. suffer from alcoholism that contributed to his early death in 1981.[66][67] Trump said that he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father.[68] He appeared on the initial Forbes 400 list of wealthy individuals in 1982 with an estimated $200\u00a0million fortune, including an \"undefined\" share of his parents' estate.[69] During the late 1980s he became a billionaire,[70], and made the Forbes World's Billionaires list for the first time in 1989,[71] but he was absent from the Forbes 400 list following business losses from 1990 to 1995; he reportedly borrowed from his siblings' trusts in 1993.[69] His father's estate, valued at more than $20\u00a0million, was divided in 1999 among Trump, his three surviving siblings and their children.[72][73] When Trump announced his candidacy for the presidency on June 16, 2015, he released a one-page financial summary that stated a net worth of $8,737,540,000.[75] The following month, he filed a 92-page FEC financial disclosure form[76] and declared his net worth was \"in excess of ten billion dollars\".[77] In his presidential announcement speech, he said \"I'm really rich\", and stated this would make him less indebted to large campaign donors.[78][79] Forbes believed his net worth estimate was \"a whopper\", setting their own estimate at $4.1\u00a0billion in 2015. Trump valued his \"properties under development\" at $293 million; Forbes said they could not evaluate those deals, and booked them for $0.[80][81] Trump's 2015 FEC disclosure reported $362\u00a0million in total income for the year 2014.[77] After Trump made controversial remarks about illegal immigrants in 2015, he lost business contracts with several companies; this reduced his Forbes estimate by $125\u00a0million.[82] Consumer boycotts and reduced bookings may have further affected his brand value during the presidential campaign.[83][84][85] Trump's 104-page FEC disclosure in May 2016[86] still claimed a total wealth over $10\u00a0billion, unchanged from 2015.[76] The release of the Access Hollywood tapes in October 2016 put further pressure on his brand,[87] but real estate experts predicted a positive rebound after he was elected.[88] In its 2017 billionaires' ranking, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $3.5\u00a0billion (544th in the world, 201st in the U.S.)[1] making him one of the richest politicians in American history. These estimates fluctuate from year to year, and among various analysts. In July 2016 Bloomberg News had pegged his wealth at $3\u00a0billion, calling it an increase thanks to his presidential nomination,[89] whereas Forbes had ranked him 324th in the world (113th in the U.S.) with $4.5\u00a0billion just a few months earlier.[90] The discrepancies among these estimates and with Trump's own figures stem from the uncertain values of appraised property and of his personal brand.[89][91] Trump started his career at his father's real estate development company, Elizabeth Trump and Son, which focused on middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs, but also had business elsewhere.[92] For example, during his undergraduate study, Trump joined his father Fred in successfully revitalizing the foreclosed Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, thereby boosting the occupancy rate from 66% to 100%.[93][94] When his father became chairman of the board in 1971, Trump was promoted to president of the company and renamed it The Trump Organization.[7][95] In 1973, he and his father drew wider attention when the Justice Department contended that the organization systematically discriminated against African Americans wishing to rent apartments rather than merely screening out people based on low income as the Trumps stated. Under an agreement reached in 1975, the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing, and made the Urban League an intermediary for qualified minority applicants.[96][97] His adviser and attorney during (and after) that period was Roy Cohn, who responded to attacks by counterattacking with maximum force, and who valued both positive and negative publicity, which were attitudes that Trump appreciated.[98] In 1978, Trump consummated his first major real estate deal in Manhattan when he purchased a half-share in the decrepit Commodore Hotel. The purchase was largely funded by a $70\u00a0million construction loan that was jointly guaranteed by Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain. Designed by architect Der Scutt, the project was able to proceed by leveraging competing interests and by taking advantage of tax breaks.[99] After remodeling, the hotel reopened as the Grand Hyatt Hotel, located next to Grand Central Terminal.[100][101] Also in 1978, Trump finished negotiations to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 202-meter (663-foot) skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, which The New York Times attributed to his \"persistence\" and \"skills as a negotiator\".[102] To make way for the new building, a crew of undocumented Polish workers demolished an old Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features that had initially been marked for preservation.[103] The building was completed in 1983 and houses both the primary penthouse condominium residence of Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization.[104][105] Architectural critic Paul Goldberger said in 1983 that he was surprised to find the tower's atrium was \"the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years\".[106][107] Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television show The Apprentice and includes a fully functional television studio set.[108] Repairs on Central Park's Wollman Rink were started in 1980 by a general contractor who was unconnected to Trump. Despite an expected two and one-half\u00a0year construction schedule, the repairs were not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project, completed it in three months for $1.95\u00a0million, $775,000 less than the initial budget, and operated the rink for one year with all profits going to charity in exchange for the rink's concession rights.[109] In 1988 Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for a record-setting $407\u00a0million and asked his wife Ivana to manage its operation.[110] Trump invested $50\u00a0million to restore the building, which he called \"the Mona Lisa\".[111] According to hotel expert Thomas McConnell, the Trumps boosted it from a three-star to a four-star ranking and sold it in 1995, by which time Ivana was no longer involved.[112] In 1994, Trump became involved with a building on Columbus Circle that was swaying in the wind. He began a reconstruction project that stopped the swaying and gave the building a full makeover.[113][114] Trump thereafter owned commercial space in that 44-story mixed-use tower (hotel and condominium), which he named Trump International Hotel and Tower.[115] In 1996, Trump acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street that had briefly been the tallest building in the world when it was completed in 1930. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street.[116] In 1997, he began construction on Riverside South, which he dubbed Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. The project encountered delays the following year because a subcontracter had to replace defective concrete.[117][118] He and the other investors in the project ultimately sold their interest for $1.8 billion in 2005 in what was then the biggest residential sale in the history of New York City.[119] From 1994 to 2002, Trump owned a 50% share of the Empire State Building. He would have renamed it \"Trump Empire State Building Tower Apartments\" if he had been able to boost his share.[120][121] In 2001, Trump completed Trump World Tower, which was across from the headquarters of the United Nations. For a while, the structure was the tallest all-residential tower in the world.[122] In 2002, Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue; the building consisted of 35 stories of luxury condominiums.[123] Meanwhile, he continued to own millions of square feet of other prime Manhattan real estate.[124] In 1985, Trump acquired the historic Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida for $5\u00a0million plus $3\u00a0million for the home's furnishings. The home was built in the 1920s by heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post, who envisioned the house as a future winter retreat for American presidents. Trump's initial offer of $28\u00a0million had been rejected, and he was able to get the property at the much lower price by purchasing separate beachfront property and threatening to build a house on it that would block Mar-a-Lago's ocean view. In addition to using the estate as a home, Trump also turned it into a private club open to everyone who could afford the initiation fee of $100,000 plus annual dues.[125] In 1986, Trump acquired a foreclosed 33-story, twin-tower condominium complex in nearby West Palm Beach for $40\u00a0million. Auto CEO Lee Iacocca invested in three of the condos.[126] Trump spruced up the complex's public areas and heavily promoted the property for years, but selling the units proved difficult, and the deal turned out to be unprofitable.[127] New Jersey legalized casino gambling in 1977, and the following year Trump was in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to explore how he might get involved in a new business venture. Seven years later, Harrah's at Trump Plaza hotel and casino opened there; the multi-use unit was built by Trump with financing from Holiday Corporation, which also was managing that business.[128] Renamed \"Trump Plaza\" soon after opening, it was at that time the tallest building in Atlantic City.[129] The casino's poor financial results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp., which led to Trump's paying $70\u00a0million in May 1986 to buy out their interest in the property.[130][131] Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320\u00a0million; when completed in 1985, that hotel and casino became Trump Castle, and Trump's wife, Ivana, managed that property until Trump transferred her in 1988 to run the Trump Plaza Hotel in New York.[132][133] Also in 1988, Trump acquired his third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal (then halfway through construction), by making a complex transaction with the television host and entertainer Merv Griffin as well as the resort and casino company Resorts International.[134] In October 1989, three of his top Atlantic City executives were killed in a helicopter accident, which both stymied and delayed the planned opening of the Taj Mahal.[135] The Taj finally opened in April 1990 and was built at a total cost of $1.1\u00a0billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever.[136][137] The project was financed with $675\u00a0million in junk bonds[138] and was a major gamble by Trump.[139] The project underwent debt restructuring the following year,[140] leaving Trump with 50% ownership.[141] He also sold his 282-foot (86\u00a0m) megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers.[142][143] In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana.[144] THCR purchased Taj Mahal in 1996 and underwent bankruptcy restructuring in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[145] From mid 1995 until early 2009, he served as chairman of the publicly-traded THCR organization\u2014which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts\u2014and served as CEO from mid 2000 to mid 2005.[146] During the 1990s, Trump's casino ventures faced competition from Native American gaming at the Foxwoods casino located on an Indian reservation in Connecticut, where it was exempt from the state's anti-gambling laws. Trump stated in 1993 that the casino owners did not look like real Indians to him or to other Indians.[147] Subsequent to that well-publicized remark about the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, Trump became a key investor backing the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots, who were also seeking state recognition.[148] The Trump Organization operates many golf courses and resorts in the United States and around the world. According to Golfweek, Trump owns or manages about 18 golf courses.[149] His personal financial disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission stated that his golf and resort revenue for the year 2015 was roughly $382\u00a0million,[76][86] while his three European golf courses did not show a profit.[89] In 2006, Trump bought 1,400\u00a0acres (570\u00a0ha), including the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and created a golf resort there.[150] Scottish supporters emphasized potential economic benefits, and opponents emphasized potential environmental harm to a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).[151][152][153] A spokesperson for the golf course has said 95% of the SSSI is untouched.[154] A 2011 independent documentary, You've Been Trumped, chronicled the golf resort's construction and struggles.[155] In 2015, an offshore windfarm being built within sight of the golf course prompted a legal challenge by Trump, which was dismissed by the U.K. Supreme Court.[156] In the wake of the 2008 recession, Trump greatly scaled back development of this property, and as of December 2016 Scottish officials were pushing for completion of the far larger development as originally approved.[157] In April 2014, Trump purchased the Turnberry hotel and golf resort in Ayrshire, Scotland, which hosted the Open Championship four times between 1977 and 2009.[158][159] After extensive renovations and a remodeling of the course by golf architect Martin Ebert, Turnberry was re-opened in June 2016.[160] In the late 2000s and early 2010s, The Trump Organization expanded its footprint in the United States beyond New York and into a few other countries with the co-development and management of hotel towers in Chicago, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., Panama City, Toronto, and Vancouver. There are also Trump-branded buildings in Dubai, Honolulu, Istanbul, Manila, Mumbai and in Indonesia.[161] Trump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies. He has also licensed his name for various commercial products and services. In doing so, he achieved mixed success for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects.[162] In 2011, Forbes' financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200\u00a0million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3\u00a0billion.[163] As of 2016, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 3,500 state and federal legal actions. He or one of his companies was the plaintiff in 1,900 cases and the defendant in 1,450. With Trump or his company as plaintiff, more than half the cases have been against gamblers at his casinos who had failed to pay off their debts. With Trump or his company as a defendant, the most common type of case involved personal injury cases at his hotels. In cases where there was a clear resolution, Trump's side won 451 times and lost 38.[164][165] Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, but his hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[166][167] Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, \"I do play with the bankruptcy laws\u00a0\u2013 they're very good for me\" as a tool for trimming debt.[168][169] The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[170][171] Trump said, \"I've used the laws of this country to pare debt\u00a0... We'll have the company. We'll throw it into a chapter. We'll negotiate with the banks. We'll make a fantastic deal. You know, it's like on The Apprentice. It's not personal. It's just business.\"[140] A 2016 analysis of Trump's business career by The Economist concluded that his \"...\u00a0performance [from 1985 to 2016] has been mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York\", noting both his successes and bankruptcies.[172] A subsequent analysis by The Washington Post concluded that \"Trump is a mix of braggadocio, business failures, and real success\", calling his casino bankruptcies the \"most infamous flop\" of his business career.[173] After Trump took charge of the family real estate firm in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization, he not only greatly expanded its real estate operations, but also ventured into numerous other business activities. The company eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.[174] In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals\u2014an American football team that played in the United States Football League (USFL)\u2014from oil magnate J.\u00a0Walter Duncan. The USFL played three seasons during the spring and summer. After the 1985 season, the organization folded due to continuous financial difficulties, despite winning an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL.[175] Trump remained involved with other sports after the Generals folded; he operated golf courses in several countries.[175] At the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, he hosted several boxing matches, which included Mike Tyson's 1988 heavyweight championship fight against Michael Spinks.[176] He also acted as a financial advisor to Mike Tyson.[177] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[178] From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe pageants.[179][180] The Miss Universe Pageants include Miss USA and Miss Teen USA, and his management of this business involved his family members; for example, daughter Ivanka once hosted Miss Teen USA. Trump hired the first female president of the Miss Universe business in 1997.[181] He became dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled the pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002.[182][183] In his 2015 U.S. presidential campaign kickoff speech, Trump made statements about illegal immigrants who crossed the border from Mexico. NBC then decided to end its business relationship with him and stated that it would no longer air the Miss Universe or Miss USA pageants on its networks.[184] In September 2015, Trump bought NBC's share of the Miss Universe Organization and became its sole owner for three days. He then sold the entire company to the WME/IMG talent agency.[185] Trump University was a for-profit education company that was founded by Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny. The company ran a real estate training program and charged between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[186][187][188] In 2005, the operation was notified by New York State authorities that its use of the word \"university\" was misleading and violated state law. After a second such notification in 2010, the name of the company was changed to the \"Trump Entrepreneurial Institute\".[189] Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[190] In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40\u00a0million civil suit alleging that Trump University made false statements and defrauded consumers.[189][191] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court relating to Trump University; they named Trump personally as well as his companies.[192] During the presidential campaign, Trump criticized Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel who oversaw those two cases, alleging bias in his rulings because of his Mexican heritage.[193][194] Shortly after Trump won the presidency, the parties agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases, whereby Trump paid a total of $25\u00a0million and denied any wrongdoing.[195][196] The Donald J. Trump Foundation is a U.S.-based private foundation[197] established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal.[198][199] The foundation's funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump,[200] who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.[200] The foundation's tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[201] In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York\u2013Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000).[202][203] From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5\u00a0million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007.[200] Linda McMahon later became Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[204] In 2016, investigations by The Washington Post uncovered several potential legal and ethical violations conducted by the charity, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[205] After beginning an investigation into the foundation, the New York State Attorney General's office notified the Trump Foundation that it was allegedly in violation of New York laws regarding charities, and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[206][207][208] A Trump spokesman called the investigation a \"partisan hit job\".[206] In response to mounting complaints, Trump's team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove \"even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President.\"[209] When Trump was elected president of the United States in November 2016, questions arose over how he would avoid conflicts of interest between his work in the White House and his business activities. At a press conference on January 10, 2017, Trump said that he and his daughter Ivanka would resign all roles with The Trump Organization, while his two adult sons Don Jr. and Eric would run the business, together with Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg.[210] Trump retained his financial stake in the business.[211] His attorney Sherri Dillon said that before the January 20 inauguration, Trump would put those business assets into a trust, which would hire an ethics advisor and a compliance counsel. She added that The Trump Organization would not enter any new foreign business deals, while continuing to pursue domestic opportunities.[212] As of April 2017, Trump companies owned more than 400 condo units and home lots in the United States, valued at over $250\u00a0million in total ($200,000 to $35\u00a0million each).[213] In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show The Apprentice, in which a group of competitors battled for a high-level management job in one of Trump's commercial enterprises. Contestants were successively \"fired\" and eliminated from the game. For the first year of the show, Trump earned $50,000 per episode (roughly $700,000 for the first season), but following the show's initial success, he was paid $1\u00a0million per episode.[214] In a July 2015 press release, Trump's campaign manager said that NBCUniversal had paid him $213,606,575 for his 14 seasons hosting the show,[77] although the network did not verify the statement.[215] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to television on The Apprentice.[162][216] Along with British TV producer Mark Burnett, Trump was hired as host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities compete to win money for their charities. While Trump and Burnett co-produced the show, Trump stayed in the forefront, deciding winners and \"firing\" losers. International versions of The Apprentice franchise were co-produced by Burnett and Trump. On February 16, 2015, NBC announced that they would be renewing The Apprentice for a 15th season.[217] On February 27, Trump stated that he was \"not ready\" to sign on for another season because of the possibility of a presidential run.[218] Despite this, on March 18, NBC announced they were going ahead with production.[219] On June 29, after widespread negative reaction stemming from Trump's campaign announcement speech, NBC released a statement saying, \"Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump.\"[220] After Trump's election campaign and presidential win led to his departure from the program, actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced Trump as host for the fifteenth season.[221] Trump is still credited as an executive producer for the show.[222] Trump is a World Wrestling Entertainment fan and a friend of WWE chairman Vince McMahon. In 1988\u201389 Trump hosted WrestleMania IV and V at Boardwalk Hall (dubbed \"Trump Plaza\" for storyline purposes) and has been an active participant in several of the shows.[223] He also appeared in WrestleMania VII, and was interviewed ringside at WrestleMania XX.[224] Trump appeared at WrestleMania 23 in a match called \"The Battle of the Billionaires\".[223] He was in Bobby Lashley's corner, while Vince McMahon was in the corner of Lashley's opponent Umaga, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest referee.[223] The terms of the match were that either Trump or McMahon would have their head shaved if their competitor lost.[223] Lashley won the match, and so McMahon was shaved bald.[223] On June 15, 2009, McMahon announced as part of a storyline on Monday Night Raw that he had \"sold\" the show to Trump.[223] Appearing on screen, Trump declared that he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person and would give a full refund to the people who purchased tickets to the arena for that night's show.[223] McMahon \"bought back\" Raw the following week for twice the price.[223] In 2013, Trump was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame at Madison Square Garden for his contributions to the promotion. He made his sixth WrestleMania appearance the following night at WrestleMania 29.[225] As president, Trump appointed WWE CEO Linda McMahon to his Cabinet as Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[226] Trump has made cameo appearances in 12 films and 14 television series.[227] He played an oil tycoon in The Little Rascals,[228] and had a singing role at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2006.[229] Trump is a member of the Screen Actors Guild and receives an annual pension of more than $110,000.[230][231] His television reality show The Apprentice was twice (2004 and 2005) nominated for an Emmy Award.[232] Trump has been the subject of comedians, flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond and Alec Baldwin, and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode \"Bart to the Future\", written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform party, anticipated a future Trump presidency. A dedicated parody series called The President Show debuted in April 2017.[233] Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show on talk radio.[234] Trump also had his own daily talk radio program called Trumped!, from 2004 to 2008.[235][236][237] Since the 1980s, Trump's wealth and lifestyle have been a fixture of hip hop lyrics,[238] his name being quoted by more than 50 artists.[239] Trump first vaguely expressed interest in running for office in 1987, when he spent almost $100,000 to place full-page advertisements in several newspapers. In his view at that time, \"America should stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves\",[240] and \"should present Western Europe and Japan with a bill for America's efforts to safeguard the passage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.\"[241] According to a Gallup poll in December 1988, Trump was the tenth most admired person in America.[242][243] Trump considered running for president in 1988, 2000, 2004, and 2012, and for Governor of New York in 2006 and 2014, but aside from 2000 did not enter any of those races.[244][245] In February 2009, Trump appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and spoke about the automotive industry crisis of 2008\u201310. He said that \"instead of asking for money\", General Motors \"should go into bankruptcy and work that stuff out in a deal.\"[246] Trump publicly speculated about seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, and a Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll released in March 2011 found Trump leading among potential contenders; he was one point ahead of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.[247] A Newsweek poll conducted in February 2011 showed Trump within a few points of incumbent president Barack Obama, with many voters undecided in the November 2012 general election for president of the United States.[248] A poll released in April 2011 by Public Policy Polling showed Trump having a nine-point lead in a potential contest for the Republican nomination for president while he was still actively considering a run.[249][250] His moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[251][252][253] Trump played a leading role in \"birther\" conspiracy theories that had been circulating since President Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.[254][255] Beginning in March 2011, Trump publicly questioned Obama's citizenship and eligibility to serve as president.[256][257][258] Although the Obama campaign had released a copy of the short-form birth certificate in 2008,[259] Trump demanded to see the original \"long-form\" certificate.[256] He mentioned having sent investigators to Hawaii to research the question, but he did not follow up with any findings.[256] He also repeated a debunked allegation that Obama's grandmother said she had witnessed his birth in Kenya.[260][261] When the White House later released Obama's long-form birth certificate,[262] Trump took credit for obtaining the document, saying \"I hope it checks out.\"[263] His official biography mentions his purported role in forcing Obama's hand,[264] and he has defended his pursuit of the issue when prompted, later saying that his promotion of the conspiracy made him \"very popular\".[265] In 2011, Trump had called for Obama to release his student records, questioning whether his grades warranted entry into an Ivy League school.[266] When asked in 2015 whether he believed Obama was born in the United States, Trump said he did not want to discuss the matter further.[267][268] In September 2016, Trump publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S., and said that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign.[257][269][270] Trump made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011. His appearance at CPAC was organized by GOProud, an LGBT conservative organization, in conjunction with GOProud supporter Roger Stone, who was close with Trump. GOProud pushed for a write-in campaign for Trump at CPAC's presidential straw poll. The 2011 CPAC speech Trump gave is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[271][272] In the 2012 Republican primaries, Trump generally had polled at or below 17 percent among the crowded field of possible candidates.[273] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election, while also saying he would have become the President of the United States, had he run.[251] In 2013, Trump was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).[274] During the lightly attended early-morning speech, Trump spoke out against illegal immigration, then-President Obama's \"unprecedented media protection\", and advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.[275][276] Additionally, Trump spent over $1\u00a0million in 2013 to research a possible run for president of the United States.[277] In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. In response to the memo, Trump said that while New York had problems and that its taxes were too high, running for governor was not of great interest to him.[278] In January 2014, Trump made statements denying climate change that were discordant with the opinion of the scientific community.[279] A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election.[280] In February 2015, Trump told NBC that he was not prepared to sign on for another season of The Apprentice, as he mulled his political future.[281] Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times over the years. Trump was a Democrat prior to 1987.[282] In 1987, Trump registered as a Republican in Manhattan.[283] In 1999, Trump switched to the Reform Party and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001 due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.[284] From 2001 to 2008, Trump identified himself as a Democrat, but in 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for president. In 2009, he officially changed his party registration to Republican.[285] In December 2011, Trump became an independent for five months before returning to the Republican Party, where he later pledged to stay.[286][287] Trump has made contributions to campaigns of both Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates, with the top ten recipients of his political contributions being six Democrats and four Republicans.[288] After 2011, his campaign contributions were more favorable to Republicans than to Democrats.[289] In February 2012, Trump openly endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for president.[290] When asked in 2015 which of the last four presidents he prefers, Trump picked Democrat Bill Clinton over the Republican Bushes.[291][292] According to a New York state report, Trump circumvented corporate and personal campaign donation limits in the 1980s\u2014although no laws were broken\u2014by donating money to candidates from 18 different business subsidiaries, rather than donating primarily in his own name.[293][294] Trump told investigators he did so on the advice of his lawyers. He also said the contributions were not to gain favor with business-friendly candidates, but simply to satisfy requests from friends.[293][295] In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party in 2000.[284][296] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[297] Trump eventually dropped out of the race due to party infighting, but still went on to win the party's California and Michigan primaries.[298][299][300] On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in Manhattan. In the speech, Trump drew attention to domestic issues such as illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large priorities during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\".[301] In his campaign, Trump said that he disdained political correctness; he also stated that the media had intentionally misinterpreted his words, and he made other claims of adverse media bias.[302][303][304] In part due to his fame, Trump received an unprecedented amount of free media coverage during his run for the presidency, which elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.[305] Republican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan were hesitant to support him during his early quest for the presidency. They doubted his chances of winning the general election and feared that he could harm the image of the Republican Party.[306][307] The alt-right movement coalesced around Trump's candidacy,[308] due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[309][310] The connection of this group to the Trump campaign is controversial; writers such as Jon Ronson have suggested that the link between Trump and right-wing figures such as Alex Jones and Roger Stone is a marriage of convenience.[311] Trump personally condemned the alt-right in an interview after the election.[312] During the campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white nationalists,[313] especially in his initial refusal to condemn the support of David Duke\u2014a former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan\u2014in a CNN interview with Jake Tapper. He had previously criticized Duke in 1991, disavowed the 2000 Reform Party due to the support of Duke and others, and disavowed Duke on the campaign trail both before and after the interview.[314] In August, he appointed Steve Bannon\u2014the executive chairman of Breitbart News\u2014as his campaign CEO; the website was described by Bannon as \"the platform for the alt-right.\"[315] However, Bannon later told the Wall Street Journal that he was an \"economic nationalist\" but not \"a supporter of ethno-nationalism.\"[316] According to Michael Barkun, the Trump campaign was remarkable for bringing fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[317] Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on Trump supporters and vice-versa both inside and outside the venues.[318][319][320] Fact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates.[321][322][323] At least four major publications\u00a0\u2013 Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times\u00a0\u2013 have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements.[324] NPR said that Trump's campaign statements were often opaque or suggestive.[325] Lucas Graves, an assistant professor of journalism and mass communication at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison,[326] opined that Trump \"often speaks in a suggestive way that makes it unclear what exactly he meant, so that fact-checkers \"have to be really careful\" when picking claims to check, \"to pick things that reflect what the speaker was clearly trying to communicate.\"[327] Trump's penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth and where puffery abounds.[328] Trump has called his public speaking style \"truthful hyperbole\", an effective political tactic that may, however, backfire for overpromising.[328] Martin Medhurst, a Baylor University professor of communication and political science, analyzed Trump's frequently used rhetorical devices, such as catchy slogans, hyperbole, insinuations and preterition.[329] In compliance with FEC regulations of all presidential candidates, Trump published a 92-page financial disclosure form in 2015; the form listed all of his assets, liabilities, income sources and hundreds of business positions.[76] His decision not to release his tax returns[330] was contrary to usual practice by every presidential candidate since Gerald Ford in 1976.[331] Although there is no law that requires presidential candidates to release their returns,[332] Trump's refusal led to speculation that he was hiding something.[333] Trump explained that his tax returns were being audited and his lawyers had advised him against releasing the returns.[334][335] However, no law prohibits release of tax returns during an audit.[336] Tax attorneys differ about whether such a release is wise legal strategy.[337] Trump has told the news media that his tax rate was \"none of your business\", but added, \"I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible.\"[338][339][340] On October 1, 2016, three pages of Trump's 1995 tax return were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times, who said she received the documents in her Times mailbox. Each of the three pages is one page from Trump's state filings in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. They show that using allowed deductions for losses, Trump claimed a loss of $916\u00a0million that year. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.[341] When asked if he used the tax code to avoid paying taxes, he said, \"Of course I did. Of course I did.\" He then went on to say he paid \"hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes\", calling it a \"simple\" thing. \"I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too\", he said.[342][343][344] On March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, who unveiled them on her show. The two pages showed that Trump paid $38\u00a0million in federal taxes and had a gross adjusted income of $150\u00a0million.[345][346] The White House confirmed the authenticity of the 2005 documents and stated: \"Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.\"[345][346] Trump entered a field of 17 major candidates who were vying for the 2016 Republican nomination; this was the largest presidential field in American history.[347] Trump participated in eleven of the twelve Republican debates, skipping only the January 28 seventh debate, which was the last debate before primary voting began on the first of February. The debates received historically high television ratings, which increased the visibility of Trump's campaign.[348] By early 2016, the race had mostly centered on Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.[349] On Super Tuesday, Trump won the plurality of the vote, and he remained the front-runner throughout the remainder of the primaries. By March 2016, Trump became poised to win the Republican nomination.[350] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016\u2014which prompted the remaining candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns\u2014RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[351] With nearly 14\u00a0million votes, Trump broke the all-time record in the history of the Republican Party for winning the most primary votes. He also set the record for the largest number of votes cast against the front runner.[352] After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump shifted his focus to the general election. He urged remaining primary voters to \"save [their] vote for the general election.\"[353] Trump began campaigning against Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016, and continued to campaign across the country. Clinton had established a significant lead over Trump in national polls throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton's lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI's re-opening of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy.[354][355][356] On July 15, 2016, Trump announced his selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate.[357] Four days later on July 19, Trump and Pence were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the Republican National Convention.[358] The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole, but the other prior nominees did not attend.[359][360] Two days later, Trump officially accepted the nomination in a 76-minute speech that was inspired by Richard Nixon's 1968 acceptance speech.[361] The historically long speech was watched by nearly 35\u00a0million people and received mixed reviews, with net negative viewer reactions according to CNN and Gallup polls.[362][363][364] On September 26, 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton faced off in their first presidential debate, which was held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. NBC News anchor Lester Holt was the moderator.[365] The TV broadcast was the most watched presidential debate in United States history.[366] The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning narrative of that debate was dominated by a leaked tape of Trump making lewd comments, and counter-accusations by Trump of sexual misconduct done by Bill Clinton. Trump had invited four women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to a press conference prior to the debate. The final presidential debate was held on October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Trump's refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular press attention.[367][368] Trump's campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.\u2013China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. His other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. During the campaign, he also advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS or IS). Media have described Trump's political positions as \"populist\",[369][370] and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation,[371] consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment,[372] usually considered a liberal (Democratic Party) policy.[373][374] According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a \"fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views\", but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[375][376] Trump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time.[377][378][379] Politico has described his positions as \"eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory\",[379] while NBC News counted \"141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues\" during his campaign.[380] In January 2017, American intelligence agencies \u2013 the CIA, FBI and NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence \u2013 jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government attempted to intervene in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[381][382] In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, former FBI Director James Comey affirmed he has \"no doubt\" that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, adding \"they did it with purpose and sophistication\".[383][384] Trump claims that the investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election is the pursuit of a false narrative, calling it \"the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!\"[385] Russian president Vladimir Putin echoed Trump's opinion, saying that Democrats cling to this fictitious explanation to avoid confronting their election loss.[386] There has been intensive media scrutiny of Trump's relationship to Russia.[387][388] During the campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a strong leader.[389][390] One of his campaign managers, Paul Manafort, had worked for several years to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovich win the Ukrainian presidency.[391] Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, have been connected to Russian officials.[392][393] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[394] Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[395] In a December 29, 2016 conversation, Flynn and Kislyak discussed the recently imposed sanctions against Russia; Trump later fired Flynn for falsely claiming he had not discussed the sanctions.[396] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that \"the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\"[397] In 2017, Trump and other senior White House officials asked the Director of National Intelligence, the NSA director, the FBI director, and two chairs of congressional committees to publicly dispute the news reports about contacts between Trump associates and Russia.[398] Two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women.[399][400][401] The hot mic recording was captured on a studio bus in which Trump and Billy Bush were preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. \"I just start kissing them,\" Trump said, \"I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything\u00a0... grab them by the pussy.\"[402] During the recording, Trump also spoke of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he \"moved on her very heavily.\"[402] These statements were recorded several months after Trump married his third and current wife, Melania, who was pregnant at the time.[402][403] Trump's language on the tape was described by the media as \"vulgar\", \"sexist\", and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident prompted him to make his first public apology during the campaign,[404][405] and caused outrage across the political spectrum,[406][407] with many Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of his candidacy and some urging him to quit the race.[408] Subsequently, at least 15 women[409] came forward with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping, resulting in widespread media coverage.[410][411] Trump and his campaign have denied all of the sexual misconduct accusations, which Trump has called \"false smears\", and alleged a conspiracy against him.[412][413][414] In his two public statements in response to the controversy, Trump responded by alleging that Bill Clinton, former President of the United States and husband of Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, had \"abused women\" and that Hillary had bullied her husband's victims.[415] On Election Day, November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232 votes. The counts were later adjusted to 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides, formalizing Trump's election to the presidency.[416] In the early hours of November 9, Clinton called Trump to concede the election. Trump then delivered his victory speech before hundreds of supporters in the New York Hilton hotel. The speech was in contrast with some of his previous rhetoric, with Trump promising to heal the division caused by the election, thanking Clinton for her service to the country, and promising to be a president to all Americans.[417][418] Trump received a smaller share of the popular vote than Clinton, making him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[419][nb 1] Clinton finished ahead by 2.86\u00a0million votes or 2.1 percentage points, 48.04% to 46.09%, with neither candidate reaching a majority nationwide.[422][423] Trump's victory was considered a stunning political upset, as polls consistently showed Hillary Clinton leading nationwide (which were consistent with her win in the popular vote) and in most battleground states, while Trump's support had been underestimated throughout his campaign.[424] The errors in some state polls were later partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton's support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump's support among white working-class voters.[425] Trump won the perennial swing states of Florida, Iowa and Ohio, and flipped Clinton's \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which had been Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Trump's victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control of both chambers of Congress, as was the case during parts of George W. Bush's presidency from 2003 to 2007. Trump is the wealthiest president in U.S. history.[426] He is also the first president without prior governmental or military experience.[427][428][429] Of the 43[nb 2] previous presidents, 38 had held prior elective office; two had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet; and three had never held public office but had been commanding generals.[429] Trump's election victory sparked protests across the United States. His opponents took to the streets to amplify their opposition to Trump's views and denounce his inflammatory statements. Trump initially said on Twitter that the protests consisted of \"professional protesters, incited by the media\", and were \"unfair\", but he later stated that he loves their passion for the country.[431][432] After Obama's re-election in 2012, Trump had tweeted \"We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!\"[433] On the Saturday following Trump's inauguration, massive demonstrations took place in the United States and worldwide in protest of Trump; approximately 2,600,000 people took part in Women's Marches worldwide.[434] One of these marches was the Women's March on Washington (in Washington, D.C.), where over 500,000 people marched in opposition to Trump.[435] On November 10, Trump had his first ever meeting with outgoing president Barack Obama to discuss plans for an orderly transition of power. The New York Times said, \"It was an extraordinary show of cordiality and respect between two men who have been political enemies and are stylistic opposites.\"[436] The BBC stated that \"their antipathy was barely concealed\" in \"awkward photos\" of the meeting.[437] New Jersey Governor Chris Christie led Trump's transition team until November 11, 2016, when Vice President-elect Mike Pence took over.[438] In the White House, Trump chose RNC chairman Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff;[439] he was replaced by retired Marine General John F. Kelly on July 28, 2017.[440] He appointed businessman and media executive Steve Bannon as White House Chief Strategist;[441] Bannon resigned on August 18, 2017 and no replacement has been named.[442] Trump's cabinet nominations included Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General,[443] financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury,[444] retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense,[445] and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.[446] Trump also brought on board politicians who had opposed him during the presidential campaign, notably neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[447] and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations.[448] While most of Trump's nominees were approved by the GOP majority in the Senate, the confirmation of education reform activist Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education[449] required Vice President Pence to cast a rare tie-breaking vote.[450] Most cabinet members were unable to take office on Inauguration Day because of delays in the formal confirmation process. Part of the lateness was ascribed to delays in submitting background-check paperwork, and part to obstructionism by Senate Democrats.[451] The last Cabinet member, Robert Lighthizer, took office as U.S. Trade Representative on May 11, 2017, more than four months after his nomination.[452] On November 22, Trump outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office in a video posted on YouTube. The plan included the United States' withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and asking the U.S. Department of Defense to develop a plan to protect the U.S. from cyber-attack.[453][454] On December 7, Time named Trump as its \"Person of the Year\".[455] In an interview on The Today Show, he said he was honored by the award, but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the \"President of the Divided States of America.\"[456][457] He also opposed Time's decision to change its \"Man of the Year\" title to \"Person of the Year\" in 1999, describing the action as too \"politically correct\".[458] On December 13 he was named Financial Times Person of the Year.[459] In December 2016, Forbes ranked Trump the second most powerful person in the world, after Vladimir Putin and before Angela Merkel.[460] Based on intelligence reports issued from October 2016 to January 2017, the Obama administration accused the Russian government of trying to influence the U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump, by supplying the DNC emails to WikiLeaks for publication.[461] Trump,[462] WikiLeaks[463] and Russian officials[464] have denied the allegations. Trump's inauguration as the 45th president was held on Friday, January 20, 2017. In his first week as president, Trump signed six executive orders. His first order as president set out interim procedures in anticipation of repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). That same week, Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, re-instated the Mexico City Policy, reopened the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects and signed an executive order to begin planning, designing and constructing a new Mexico border wall and reinforce border security.[465] On January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[466] The Senate confirmed the nomination on April 7 with a 54\u201345 vote.[467] On January 27, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns about terrorism. The order was imposed without warning and took effect immediately.[468] Confusion and protests caused chaos at many airports,[469] as travelers were detained on arriving in the United States or barred from boarding U.S.-bound planes.[470] The administration then clarified that visitors with a green card were exempt from the ban.[471][472] On January 30, Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General, directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the executive order and was promptly dismissed.[473] She was replaced as acting Attorney General by Dana Boente, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who agreed to enforce the order.[474] Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and on February 5 a federal judge in Seattle blocked its implementation.[475][476] On October 24, 2017, the Supreme Court dismissed the only remaining travel ban appeal as being moot because the revised order had expired. It expressed \"no views on the merits\" of the case.[477] On March 6, Trump issued a revised order, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, removed priorities for religious minorities (e.g. Christian refugees), and allowed for a week to implement legislation.[478][468] Again federal judges in Hawaii, Maryland and Virginia blocked its implementation.[479] On June 26, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the lower courts and allowed most provisions of the revised executive order to take effect. The Supreme Court ruled that Trump's ban can be enforced on visitors from targeted countries who lack a \"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\"[480] The court scheduled full hearings in October.[480] On September 24, 2017, the temporary executive order, which was close to expiry, was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea, Chad, and Venezuela (only on certain government officials and their families).[481] These provisions were slated to take effect on October 18,[481] and the Supreme Court cancelled the hearing that was planned for October 10.[482] On October 17, a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the portions of these provisions applying to the six Muslim-majority countries, leaving only the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela to take effect.[483] On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey. He attributed the action to recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein,[484] which criticized Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails.[485] On May 11, Trump stated that he was concerned with the ongoing \"Russia thing\"[486] and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[487] According to a Comey memo of a private conversation on February 14, 2017, Trump said he \"hoped\" Comey would drop the investigation into Michael Flynn,[488] who had been forced to resign as National Security Advisor after it was discovered that he had misled the Vice President about communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. In March and April, Trump had told Comey that the ongoing suspicions formed a \"cloud\" impairing his presidency,[489] and asked him to publicly state that he was not personally under investigation.[490] He also asked DNI Dan Coats and NSA Director Michael Rogers to issue statements saying there was no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.[491] Both refused, considering this an inappropriate request, although not illegal.[492] Comey eventually testified on June 8 that while he was director, the FBI investigations did not target Trump himself.[489][493] The Washington Post later reported that within days of Comey's dismissal, the FBI started investigating whether Trump had obstructed justice.[494] Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow stated that he had not been notified of any such investigation.[495] ABC News later reported that the special counsel is gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice but has not launched a full-scale investigation.[496] Trump attracted attention for implying that he had \"tapes\" of conversations with Comey, before later stating that he did not in fact have such tapes.[497] As president, Trump has frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks.[498][499][500] Trump uttered \"at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days\" in office according to The New York Times,[498] and 1,318 total in his first 263 days in office according to the \"Fact Checker\" political analysis column of The Washington Post,[501] which also wrote, \"President Trump is the most fact-challenged politician that The Fact Checker has ever encountered... the pace and volume of the president's misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up.\"[499] Trump's energy policy advocates domestic industrial support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter.[502] His appointed advisers favor a less regulated energy market and, because they do not consider climate change a threat, see no need for immediate action.[503] Trump does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.[504][505] In 2012, he said that global warming was a hoax invented by the Chinese, but later said that he was joking.[506][507] He has called the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a \"disgrace\" and has threatened to cut its budget.[508] Trump pledged to eliminate the Clean Power Plan[509] and withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which calls for reductions in carbon emissions in more than 170 countries.[510] After winning the presidency, Trump said he had an \"open mind\" towards the Paris agreement,[511] but on June 1, 2017, he announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, making the United States one of only three nations at the time, besides Syria and Nicaragua, not to be members.[512] Trump's immigration policies were intensely discussed during the campaign. Trump vowed to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico\u2013United States border to keep out illegal immigrants, a wall that Trump promised Mexico would pay for.[513][514][515] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[516] and criticized birthright citizenship as it creates \"anchor babies\".[517] He said the focus of deportation would be criminals, those who have overstayed their visas, and other \"security threats\".[518] Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to completely ban Muslim non-citizens from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[519][520][521] Later in 2016 he stated that the ban would apply only to people originating from countries with a \"proven history of terrorism against the United States or its allies\", or countries \"compromised by terrorism\".[522][523][524] Shortly after coming into office, Trump issued a limited travel ban, which was suspended by federal courts and eventually came into effect following a June 2017 Supreme Court decision.[480] Trump is conservative, describes himself as pro-life, and generally opposes abortion; exceptions are made in cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[525] He has said that he is committed to appointing justices who would try to overturn the ruling in Roe v. Wade.[526] He personally supports \"traditional marriage\"[506] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a \"settled\" issue.[526] Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[527][528] although his views have shifted over time.[529] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[530] He favors capital punishment,[531][532] as well as the use of waterboarding.[533][534] In 1999, Trump told Larry King Live that \"I believe in universal healthcare.\"[535] Trump's 2000 book, The America We Deserve, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model,[536] and has voiced admiration for the Scottish National Health Service.[535][537][538] As a candidate Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare.[539][540] Starting early in his presidency he urged Congress to repeal and replace it. In May the United States House of Representatives voted to repeal the ACA.[541] However, the Senate tried for several months but was unable to pass any of several versions of a repeal bill.[542] Trump has expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\", and the Trump administration has cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[543][544][545] Trump aims to streamline the Department of Veterans Affairs, getting rid of backlogs and waitlists, and upgrading relevant facilities.[546] On his first Monday in office, Trump issued a federal hiring freeze on the VA.[547] Trump has stated his support for school choice and local control for primary and secondary schools.[548] He opposes the Common Core State Standards Initiative for primary and secondary schools,[549] and has called it \"a disaster\" that must be ended.[550] He has stated he would abolish all or part of the Department of Education.[551] Trump's campaign tax plan called for levelling the corporate tax rate to 15%, eliminating various business loopholes and deductions,[371] and reducing the number of brackets for personal income tax: the top rate would be reduced from 39.6% to 25%, a large \"zero bracket\" would be created, and the alternative minimum tax and estate tax (which currently applies to individual estates over $5.45\u00a0million or $10.9\u00a0million per married couple) would both be eliminated.[552] His comments about the minimum wage have been inconsistent.[553][554][555] Trump identifies as a \"free trader\", but says that trade must be \"reasonably fair\".[556] He has often been called a \"protectionist\",[557][558][559] because of his criticism of NAFTA,[560][561] the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),[562] and his proposal to significantly raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States.[563][564] He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted.[565][566] However, Trump has been very keen to support a \"fair\" post-Brexit trade deal with the United Kingdom,[567] which Trump says would be \"good for both sides\".[568] Trump's early policies have favored deregulation and a smaller federal government. He became the first president in sixteen years to sign a Congressional Review Act disapproval resolution; the law had been used only once before.[569] During his first six weeks in office, he abolished ninety federal regulations.[570][571] On January 23, 2017, Trump ordered a temporary government-wide hiring freeze, which allows for exceptions, primarily for jobs deemed vital for national security or public safety reasons.[572][573] The Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office told a House committee that hiring freezes have not proven to be effective in reducing costs.[574] Unlike some past freezes, the current freeze bars agencies from adding contractors to make up for employees leaving.[574] A week later Trump signed Executive Order 13771, directing administrative agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation they issue.[575][576] Harvard Law professor Jody Freeman said that the order would do no more than slow the regulatory process, because it did not block rules required by statute.[577] On February 24, 2017, Trump ordered the agencies to create task forces to determine which regulations are deemed burdensome to the U.S. economy.[578] Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump's criticisms, saying that the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups.[579] Trump has been described as non-interventionist[580][581] and nationalist.[582] He repeatedly stated that he supports \"America First\" foreign policy.[583] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[582] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[584] He says America should look inward, stop \"nation building\", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[581] As a candidate he questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[585] and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[586] But as president he has reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to NATO.[587] In order to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Trump in 2015 called for seizing the oil in ISIS-occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops.[588] In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region,[589][590] a position he later retracted.[591] Regarding the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is \"a big fan of Israel\".[592] During the campaign he said he would relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from its current location, Tel Aviv, although he has not pursued that proposal as president.[593] On May 22, 2017, Trump was the first U.S. president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem, during his first foreign trip, visiting Israel, Italy, the Vatican, and Belgium.[594] Both as a candidate and as president, Trump repeatedly said he wants a good relationship with Russia.[595][596] Trump has pledged to hold a summit meeting with Vladimir Putin.[597] He added that Russia could help the U.S. in fighting ISIS militants.[598] On April 7, 2017, Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian airfield in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[599] North Korea became a major issue in mid-2017. During the campaign and the early months of his presidency, Trump had hoped that China would help to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions and missile tests.[600] However, North Korea accelerated its missile testing, leading to an increase in tensions in April 2017.[600] In July, the country tested two long-range missiles identified by Western observers as intercontinental ballistic missiles, potentially capable of reaching Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland.[601][602] In August, Trump dramatically escalated his rhetoric against North Korea, warning that further provocation against the U.S. will be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen.\"[603] North Korean leader Kim Jong-un then threatened to direct the country's next missile test toward Guam. Trump responded that if North Korea took steps to attack Guam, \"[t]hings [would] happen to them like they never thought possible.\"[604] On July 12, 2017, California Representative Brad Sherman formally introduced an article of impeachment, H. Res. 438,[605] accusing the president of obstructing justice regarding the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.[606] Trump signaled his intention to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within hours of assuming the presidency.[607][608] This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one.[609] Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office.[610] By February 1, 2017, the campaign had already raised over $7\u00a0million.[611] SEN. MARTIN HEINRICH (D-NM): The president has repeatedly talked about ... Russia's involvement in the U.S. election cycle as \"a hoax\" and as \"fake news.\" ... JAMES COMEY: Yes, sir. There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever. The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle. They did it with purpose. They did it with sophistication. They did it with overwhelming technical efforts. And it was an active measures campaign driven from the top of that government. There is no fuzz on that. It is a high-confidence judgment of the entire intelligence community, and the members of this committee have seen the intelligence. It's not a close call. That happened. That's about as unfake as you can possibly get and is very, very serious, which is why it's so refreshing to see a bipartisan focus on that because this is about America, not about any particular party. HEINRICH: So that was a hostile act by the Russian government against this country? COMEY: Yes, sir.",
